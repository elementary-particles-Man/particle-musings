Fiscal dominance, forced monetary financing, and an accelerating loss of resource access have locked the Chinese party-state into a self-reinforcing failure loop. The headline risk is no longer whether the system can survive the winter; the question is how fast the insolvency, energy, governance, and industrial credit vectors will cascade through Asia and the global dollar system.</p><p><strong>Key Judgments</strong></p><ul><li><p>The expanded government balance sheet is insolvent. Local government financing vehicles hold roughly 57 trillion CNY of off balance sheet debt, pushing total public and quasi public liabilities above 300 percent of GDP.1</p></li><li><p>Fiscal monetisation has destroyed currency credibility. The baseline timeline in DR-CHN-MACRO-COLLAPSE projects a forced depeg or double digit one off devaluation of the renminbi by H2 2025.</p></li><li><p>External resource constraints are binding.

As insolvency meets energy scarcity, the region faces a synchronized demand shock, a supply shock, and a currency shock. Japanese banks, ASEAN exporters, and commodity suppliers all move from counterparty risk to direct spread contagion as soon as the capital controls tighten.</p><hr /><h2 id="1-the-end-of-solvency">1. The End of Solvency</h2><h3 id="11-reconstructing-the-balance-sheet">1.1 Reconstructing the balance sheet</h3><p>LGFV liabilities near 57 trillion CNY, combined with central and provincial on balance sheet borrowing, place the sovereign equivalent debt load above 120 trillion CNY.1 Using a conservative 4 percent nominal growth path, the debt service burden outpaces revenue growth even before including contingent liabilities from SOEs and property developers. The decision to force the People''s Bank of China into direct and indirect purchases of fiscal paper formalises fiscal dominance and eliminates any credible lender of last resort for the banking system.</p><h3 id="12-the-devaluation-trigger">1.2 The devaluation trigger</h3><p>Each incremental trillion of monetised deficit drains CNH liquidity from offshore markets, widens the onshore CNH forward curve, and accelerates capital flight. When the managed float band can no longer absorb the gap, authorities face a binary choice: draconian capital controls or a one time devaluation. Either path destroys the use of the renminbi as a regional settlement currency and drives counterparties toward JPY or SGD anchors.</p><hr /><h2 id="2-resource-exhaustion">2. Resource Exhaustion</h2><h3 id="21-the-scissor-crisis-in-energy">2.1 The scissor crisis in energy</h3><p>Imports of crude and key refined products already show double digit contraction in customs tallies, while the export rebate program for diesel and gasoline has been reactivated to raise cash. Strategic petroleum reserves were designed as a buffer; DR-CHN-MACRO-WINTER-GAMMA shows they now function as a slow bleeding asset that will breach minimum safe levels by Q3 2025.2 Once that threshold breaks, rationing and rolling shutdowns will hit provincial industry within weeks.</p><h3 id="22-food-and-metals">2.2 Food and metals</h3><p>China remains the world''s largest importer of soy, corn, and strategic metals. A double digit depreciation instantly reprices these imports, feeding headline CPI and forcing more relief spending. That spending is already debt financed, amplifying the fiscal loop.</p><hr /><h2 id="3-governance-implosion">3. Governance Implosion</h2><h3 id="31-political-control-replaces-market-signals">3.1 Political control replaces market signals</h3><p>The leadership response to stress has been campaign style rectification: suspending IPOs, arresting high profile bankers, and dictating credit flows sector by sector. That destroys the price discovery needed for any recapitalisation. When private entrepreneurs cannot exit, innovation collapses and capital hoarding accelerates.</p><h3 id="32-capital-controls-as-default">3.2 Capital controls as default</h3><p>Expect staged measures: outbound investment quotas, stricter SAFE approvals, and administrative delays on profit repatriation. Each intervention forces foreign creditors to shorten tenors or abandon exposure, a dynamic already visible in CNH funding costs.</p><hr /><h2 id="4-industrial-credit-destruction">4. Industrial Credit Destruction</h2><p>Quality and disclosure failures have moved from embarrassment to balance sheet threat. Electric vehicle insurers are reporting loss ratios above 100 percent, exporters of heavy machinery face repeat recalls in Europe, and safety regulators in ASEAN are moving to suspend certifications. Every recall removes foreign exchange inflow, which feeds back into S4 and S1.</p><hr /><h2 id="5-spillover-map">5. Spillover Map</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Japan and Korea:</strong> Regional banks and trading houses hold roughly USD 260 billion in China linked assets. Rising CNH hedging costs and counterparty downgrades will force accelerated provisioning.</p></li><li><p><strong>ASEAN:</strong> Supply chain relocation is expensive. Firms that cannot finance the move onshore will fail, adding unemployment to refugee pressure when Chinese migrants seek work abroad.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commodity exporters:</strong> Australia, Brazil, and Gulf states see demand volatility translate into budget gaps just as dollar funding costs spike.</p></li></ul><hr /><h2 id="6-monitoring-dashboard">6.
