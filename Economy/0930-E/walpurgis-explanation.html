		About the word "Walpurgis" used in this explanation
		</h2>
		<p>
		In this page, we will explain the global financial and economic
		<span class="negative">
			major stress scenario
		</span>
		that may occur in the future using the name
		<span class="negative">
			"Walpurgis"
		</span>
		for convenience.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is not a specific ideology or prophecy, but a conceptual name for the overlapping of multiple phenomena. Specifically, it includes the following elements.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			US fiscal year-end problem:
			</strong>
			The risk that the primary auction of US Treasury bonds will fail, which is the main topic of this page.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			A wave of global unemployment:
			</strong>
			Social unrest triggered by rapid job losses due to AI (AI layoffs), etc.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			A chain of economic crises:
			</strong>
			A chain of bankruptcies that begins with the dysfunction of the US financial system and spreads to other countries such as China.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		This series of events may mean the end of the way of thinking of "household budget finance," which treats national finances like a household budget, and the beginning of the modern monetary system (fiat system).
		</p>
		<p>
		Since it is predicted that these phenomena will become apparent
		<span class="negative">
			"at the latest on September 30, 2025,"
		</span>
		this date is used as a landmark (it may be moved up depending on the situation). The name itself has no deep meaning and is used for convenience of explanation.

		1. The beginning of everything: The "breathing" of a country and money
		</h2>
		<p>
		A country, like us, lives by paying and receiving money every day. Taxes come in, and pensions and public works expenses are paid. If this flow of money stops, the functions of the country will be paralyzed.
		</p>
		<div class="note-box">
		<p>
			<strong>
			To put it another way, it is the "breathing" of a country.
			</strong>
			We can live because the rhythm of breathing in (income) and breathing out (expenditure) does not stop. The flow of money for a country is just as important.
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		To make this breathing smooth, the country issues
		<strong>
			"government bonds."
		</strong>
		In particular, the "Treasury bills" explained next are an important tool for regulating daily breathing.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2 class="negative">
		2. What are Treasury bills? The mechanism of a country's breathing
		</h2>
		<p>
		Both Japan and the United States issue special government bonds called "Treasury bills" to execute the government's budget. This is an indispensable mechanism for the operation of a country.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			At the beginning of the fiscal year, the government's cash on hand (TGA/fiscal funds) tends to be tight in terms of management, so it first issues short-term securities to execute the daily budget (public works, civil servant salaries, etc.).
		</li>
		<li>
			Then, every time taxes are collected from individuals and companies, these short-term securities are repaid with those taxes.
		</li>
		<li>
			If money runs out, they issue short-term securities again. By repeating this, the country operates for a year without interrupting the flow of money.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		In other words,
		<strong>
			taxes are not a "source of revenue" from the beginning, but rather have a strong aspect of "repaying" the money that the country has advanced with short-term securities.
		</strong>

		3. The crucial difference in the government bond systems of Japan and the United States
		</h2>
		<p>
		What is important here is that the government bond system, including these short-term securities, is very different in Japan and the United States.

			<td style="border:1px solid var(--border-color); padding:0.8rem; text-align:left;">
				There is a law called the

				"debt ceiling,"

				which sets a ceiling on the total amount of money the government can borrow. It can also be used as a tool for political bargaining.

			</td>
			<td style="border:1px solid var(--border-color); padding:0.8rem; text-align:left;">
				Financial institutions called "primary dealers" are the main buyers. Like wholesalers, their top priority is to make a profit on the spread by buying low and selling high in the market (secondary market).

		<h3>
		(Supplement) What are the "government bond interest rates" that make the news?
		</h3>
		<p>
		You often hear in the news that "Japan's long-term interest rates have risen," but this mainly refers to the interest rates on government bonds traded in the
		<strong>
			secondary market
		</strong>
		. This is the market where government bonds that have already been issued are bought and sold among investors.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			In Japan,
			</strong>
			because there is a huge and stable buyer called the Bank of Japan, volatility tends to be relatively suppressed.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			In the United States, on the other hand,
			</strong>
			a rise in secondary interest rates is likely to be taken as a signal of "worsening supply and demand," and it has a structure that is likely to spread to the demand for dollar assets and the supply and demand of the next primary auction.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2 class="negative">
		4. What is a "primary sale failure"?
		</h2>
		<p>
		The initial sale of government bonds is conducted in an auction format, which is the
		<strong>
			"primary auction."
		</strong>
		The US government (Treasury Department) asks the market, "We want to borrow this much money, will someone lend it to us?"
		</p>
		<p>
		A situation where there are not enough buyers for this request is a
		<span class="negative">
			"primary sale failure (failed auction)."
		</span>
		</p>
		<div class="note-box">
		<p>
			<strong>
			To put it another way, it is a situation where the country's "oxygen mask" comes off.
			</strong>
			The oxygen (money) that should be relied on when breathing becomes difficult is not supplied. When this happens, the flow of money in the country is on the verge of stopping, and it has a serious impact on the whole world.
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		Primary dealers are obligated to participate in auctions, but they cannot underwrite an unlimited amount of government bonds. Depending on profitability and risk assessment, if they raise their required interest rates or reduce their bid amounts, the auction may effectively malfunction.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2 class="negative">
		5. Why is September 30 dangerous?
		</h2>
		<p>
		September 30, 2025 is the last day of the US fiscal year 2025, and it is a singular day when several bad conditions overlap.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Maturity wall:
			</strong>
			The repayment deadlines for many government bonds are concentrated, and the US government has to repay a huge amount of money.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			New issuance:
			</strong>
			To repay the money, it is necessary to issue (refinance) an even larger amount of new government bonds.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Economic factors:
			</strong>
			At this time, corporate settlements and tax payments overlap, and there is no extra money in the market as a whole.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		At this worst possible timing of "having to repay money but there is no extra money in the market," a primary auction that requires settlement on the same day will be held.
		</p>
		<div class="note-box" style="text-align:center;">
		<p>
			The estimated value of government bonds that need to be sold in the primary auction on this day is...
			<br/>
			<span class="negative" style="font-size: 2rem; font-weight: bold;">
			Approximately $365 billion to $415 billion
			</span>
			<br/>
			(equivalent to over 50 trillion yen).
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:0.9rem;color:#6c757d;margin-top:0.5rem">
			*This range is an approximate estimate based on redemption, refinancing, short-term bond rolls, and funding demand due to seasonal factors.
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		There is a concern that "there may not be enough buyers for this huge auction." This is the true nature of the scenario called "Walpurgis."
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2 class="negative">
		6. Impact on our lives
		</h2>
		<p>
		You may think, "That's an American story, right?" But if a primary sale failure really happens, it will have a big impact on our lives as well.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Wild fluctuations in the yen's appreciation and depreciation:
			</strong>
			If the dollar, the world's reserve currency, loses its credibility, the exchange rate will become volatile, and the prices of imported goods will become unstable.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Stock market decline:
			</strong>
			Global financial instability is directly linked to Japanese stock prices. The value of pensions and investment trusts may fall.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Worsening economy:
			</strong>
			The entire global economy will be in turmoil, Japanese export companies will be damaged, and it may affect our jobs and salaries.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		This problem is not a difficult economic problem in a distant country, but an important theme that could shake the foundations of our lives.
