                <p>This document assesses the risk of a failed auction (Walpurgis) in the US Treasury auction scheduled for September 30, 2025. The risk of a failed auction is rated as "medium" due to constraints on the underwriting capacity of primary dealers and the large-scale absorption of liquidity from the short-term money market.</p>

                <p>This report argues that the world's nuclear weapons are currently transitioning from a stable deterrence of "Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)" to a more unstable state of "Mutually Assured Self-destruction (MAS)." The main causes of this transition are aging systems, vulnerable C2 networks, and the spread of OSINT.</p>

                <p>This report examines the possibility that the common perception in the US state bond market that "states do not default" could be overturned by dynamic market movements. It argues that the absence of a permanent "lender of last resort" for state bonds, such as the Federal Reserve, determines the vulnerability of this crisis.</p>

                <p>This analysis examines the possibility that the three important functions that support the world's food supply (price insurance, logistics, and credit) could collapse simultaneously or in a chain reaction due to a financial and infrastructure crisis. It warns of the danger of a "modern food crisis" in which food is physically available but does not circulate in the market.</p>
