		1. The misconception that "household accounting finance" is trapped in many people
		</h2>
<p>
		"The national debt is tough," "Taxes are the source of income in the country." Many people tend to think of the country's finances in the same way as household household accounts. This
		<span class="negative">
			「家計簿財政」
		</span>
		It is called.
		</p>
<p>
		But this is a fundamental misconception. A country can issue money (currency) in its own country, but households cannot. Ignoring this critical difference, the country's economic policies tend to go in the wrong direction, such as "savings" and "austerity." As explained on the previous page, taxes are not just a source of funds, but rather a tool for "repaying" government bonds and "stabilizing" the economy.
		</p>
<p>
		This concept of "household accounting and finance" is the first barrier to understanding the modern system of money (Fiat system).

<h2 class="negative">
		2. The shocking fact that the euro is the dollar
		</h2>
<p>
		The euro looks like an independent European currency. However, the reality of this financial system is heavily dependent on the US dollar. Global financial transactions are carried out based on the dollar, and European banks also regularly exchange huge dollar funds.
		</p>
<p>
		Therefore, if the dollar's credit shaking and the US financial system becomes dysfunctional, the euro cannot escape its impact.
		<span class="negative">
			The fate of the dollar and the fate of the euro are actually deeply connected.
		</span>
		This is why Walpurgis is a global crisis, including Europe.
		</p>

<h2 class="negative">
		3. Walpurgis means "the death of the dollar"
		</h2>
<p>
		Why is it so important that "buying and selling in the primary US Treasury market"? That is the event
		<span class="negative">
			"The Death of the Dollar"
		</span>
		, that is
		<span class="negative">
			The collapse of the safety myth that "dollars no matter what" is okay
		</span>
		Because it means.
		</p>
<p>
		American government bonds are believed to be the safest assets (risk-free assets) in the world. That's why countries and investors all over the world have bought the dollar, and the dollar has maintained its position as the global core currency.
		</p>
<p>
		However, the situation in which the United States is unable to raise money (government bonds) in its own country destroys the foundation of this trust. This is the moment when the world realizes that what was thought to be "absolutely safe" was not actually the case. This is the true horror of Walpurgis.

		Why doesn't the warning come? Two powerful "normality bias"
		</h3>
<p>
		Despite such a serious risk, why do many people not listen? It is two powerful things that bind our thoughts.
		<span class="negative">
			"Normality bias (assumption)"
		</span>
		Because there exists.
		</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>
			Bias of dollar security myth:
			</strong>
			The absolute trust that has been imprinted over the years is that "there is no way America will go bankrupt" and "the dollar cannot become rubbish." This makes the risks in front of you ignored as "impossible."
		</li>
<li>
<strong>
			Bias of household accounting and finance:
			</strong>
			The false common sense is that "the national finances are the same as household finances." This prevents people from realizing the essential risks (currency confidence) that modern money mechanisms hold.
		</li>
</ol>
<p class="negative">
		This double bias is so strong that no one tries to seriously tackle it. I myself am also insignificant, and I am unable to even present a solution, "THP," in the face of this structural problem.
