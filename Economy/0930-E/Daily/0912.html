                Walpurgis perspective: While the dollar-yen is approaching 148 yen, rising long-term interest rates and the month-end issuance/redemption calendar are tightening financing. The confirmed failure of the 9/30 US Treasury primary auction suggests a supply-demand imbalance, and caution is warranted regarding abnormalities in the short-term funding market.

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>
                The mismatch between strengthening stock momentum and rising financing costs is progressing. From a Walpurgis perspective, the longer the AI-led rally continues, the more likely the vulnerability of government bond supply and demand and liquidity will surface. Assuming the confirmed failure of the 9/30 primary auction, be wary of the spillover effects of worsening repo rates and auction indicators.
