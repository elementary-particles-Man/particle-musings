            <h2>[Most Important Note] Concerns about US Regional Bank Failures Emerge, Credit Contraction Becomes Reality</h2>
            <p>
                Today, it was reported that **"Alliance Western Bank (fictitious),"** a mid-sized regional bank in the United States, is in a serious management crisis due to expanding losses related to commercial real estate (CRE) loans and subprime auto loans. As a result, the bank's stock price plummeted by over 70%, and trading was suspended.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is precisely the situation we have warned about in the "Domino Scenario." This is conclusive evidence that the credit event of a single company, the collapse of Tricolor, has finally spread to the core of the US financial system, particularly the vulnerable regional banking sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following this report, the credit market has completely frozen. The High Yield Bond Spread (HY OAS) showed an abnormal expansion of +85bp from the previous day, marking the largest increase since the Lehman Shock. The market is no longer pricing in individual corporate risks, but rather the risks of the entire system.

            <h2>Market Overview and Analysis</h2>
            <h3>From "Bad Yen Appreciation" to "Yen Appreciation under Credit Contraction"</h3>
            <p>
                After yesterday's intense volatility, today's market began to collapse with a clear direction.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Full-scale Flight to Quality:</strong> The USD/JPY once again turned towards a stronger yen, falling to the 145 yen range. This is a full-scale "flight to quality," driven by clear credit risk concerns about US regional bank failures. With gold prices continuing to rise, there is no doubt that capital outflows from the base currency, the dollar, are accelerating.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Surge in Fear Indices and Evaporation of Liquidity:</strong> The VIX index has reached 28, considered a dangerous zone, and the MOVE index, the bond market's fear index, has reached 130, a warning zone. This means that market participants are extremely fearful of further price fluctuations and are withdrawing from transactions themselves. Liquidity is beginning to disappear from the market.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Signs of a Deflationary Spiral:</strong> The decline in WTI crude oil prices is extremely important. Concerns that financial market turmoil will destroy demand in the real economy (recession concerns) have led to a fall in crude oil prices. This is an early sign that financial contraction can trigger a deflationary spiral.

            <h2>Strategic Assessment from THP</h2>
            <p>
                **The situation has reached "Gate-A (Caution)" in the "Snowball Monitoring System."**
            </p>
            <p>
                The MOVE index is above 130, and HY OAS is expanding at a pace significantly exceeding +150bp per week. This signifies a transition to the "Caution" stage in the protocol, but the reality is far more serious. A concrete event, the collapse of a regional bank, occurred earlier than the sequence we had envisioned (T-13 to T-10).
            </p>
            <p>
                The snowball is now growing at a speed visible to everyone. The next focus will be the US Treasury short-term bond auction that will take place this weekend, and the spreading concerns of chain failures to other regional banks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The War-Room officially designates the **surveillance level as "Gate-A"** as of now, and upgrades the THP-7 status from WATCH(ðŸŸ¡) to **ALERT(ðŸ”¶)**. All personnel must follow the protocol and begin preparations for the next phase.
