		1. Final Warning: "Prediction" Has Become "Reality"
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		In the early morning of September 8, Japan time, we captured abnormal movements in futures indexes in after-hours trading. Our analysis team has determined this to be definitive evidence that the
		<strong>
			Walpurgis scenario has moved beyond the mere "prediction" stage and has transitioned into an
			<u>
			observable "ongoing" event
			</u>
		</strong>
		. The events that will be observed in the Tokyo market in a few hours will be fundamentally different from the story that many people will believe.

		2. The False Narrative and the Truth We Observe
		</h2>
		<h3 class="negative">
		The False Narrative: "Caused by Prime Minister Ishiba's Resignation"
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The moment the market opens, a sharp appreciation of the yen and a surge in gold prices will be observed. The media and many market participants will link this to "political instability following Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation" and will seek to blame domestic factors in Japan. This is
		<strong>
			too simple, too convenient, and
			<u>
			completely wrong
			</u>
		</strong>
		.
		</p>
		<h3 class="negative">
		The Truth We Observe: "Flight from the Dollar"
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The only truth to this phenomenon is the fact that the credibility of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency is rapidly collapsing at this very moment. This is irrefutable evidence that Walpurgis has already begun, without waiting for the final deadline of September 30.

		3. Why the "Yen"? The Last Safe Asset
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		In a situation where the dollar and the euro are collapsing simultaneously,
		<strong>
			<u>
			by process of elimination, all capital that has lost its place will rush into the yen at once
			</u>
		</strong>
		.

		5. Conclusion: This is the "Beginning of the End"
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		The sharp appreciation of the yen and the surge in gold prices that will likely occur in the Japanese market today. It is
		<strong>
			definitely not caused by a trivial domestic issue such as "Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation."
		</strong>
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		The true cause of this movement is the structural credit anxiety inherent in the US economy and the distrust of a nation that has abandoned its own justice. This is the
		<strong>
			<u>
			sound of the first, and fatal, crack in the foundation of the huge structure called the "dollar safety myth"
			</u>
		</strong>
		that has dominated the world for decades.
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		<strong>
			We are witnessing a turning point in history.
