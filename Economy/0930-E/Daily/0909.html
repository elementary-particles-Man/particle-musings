		Summary: An eerie calm before the storm. The "distortion" continues to grow beneath the surface.
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		On September 9, the global markets seemed to have regained a semblance of calm after the turmoil following the ignition of the "Harbinger of Walpurgis" the previous day. However, a detailed analysis of the movements in each market reveals that this was not true stability, but an extremely dangerous sign that the structural "distortion" of the divergence in perceptions among major countries and the distrust of the currency system is expanding even further. Gold remains stuck at historically high levels, proving that the events of the previous day were not just a temporary panic.

		Detailed Analysis
		</h2>
		<h3>
		1. US Market: A superficial rebound and lingering distrust
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The rise on this day was not accompanied by an improvement in economic fundamentals, but was merely a technical rebound from the previous day's sharp fall. The market's attention has completely shifted to "recession concerns," and expectations of further rate cuts by the FRB are barely supporting the market.
		<strong>
			Reports of corporate bankruptcies are gradually increasing
		</strong>
		, and among market participants, a sense of caution towards the credit market is rapidly growing, contrary to the superficial movements of stock prices.
		</p>
		<h3>
		2. European Market: Renewed recognition of structural problems and continued capital outflow
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The political instability in France and the risk of corporate bankruptcies in Italy, pointed out in the report
		<strong>
			"European Financial Shock: Comprehensive Assessment"
		</strong>
		submitted the previous day, once again weighed on the market. In particular, observations that several rating agencies have begun to comment on the outlook for French government bonds have cooled investor sentiment. Expectations for drastic measures by the ECB are low, and it appears that a
		<strong>
			slow but steady outflow of funds from the Eurozone is continuing
		</strong>
		.
		</p>
		<h3 class="negative">
		3. Japanese Market: The dangerous "solitary rise" continues, turning a blind eye to global reality
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		Amid a global risk-off mood and growing distrust of the reserve currency system, only the Japanese market continues to rise, supported by the domestic-only narrative of "expectations for corporate earnings due to the weak yen." This is the
		<strong>
			only market in the world that is ignoring the harbinger of Walpurgis
		</strong>
		, and its distortion has reached an extremely dangerous level. If a global credit contraction materializes, this fragile optimism will collapse in an instant, and it carries the risk of becoming a prime target for foreign speculators.
		</p>
		<h3 class="negative">
		4. Chinese Market: Deepening real estate crisis and pressure on the yuan
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		New default concerns for major real estate developers were reported, reigniting anxiety about the real estate sector. The Chinese government's fragmented economic stimulus measures have not been effective, and capital outflow pressure to overseas is increasing again due to the uncertain economic outlook.

		Key Indicators (Forex/Commodities)
		</h2>
		<ul>
		<li class="negative">
			<strong>
			Gold:
			</strong>
			Maintained the
			<strong>
			$3,500 per ounce level
			</strong>
			. It has completely settled in the high price range. This indicates that the structural distrust of fiat currencies (dollar, euro) has reached a point of no return.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Crude Oil (WTI):
			</strong>
			Declined slightly. Concerns about a decrease in demand due to a global recession are outweighing supply concerns.

		Conclusion
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		Although the market on September 9 avoided a catastrophic crash, its silence is deceptive. The high price of gold quietly but clearly indicates that the world can no longer return to the previous financial system.
		<br/>
		The steps of each country's market are in disarray, and Japan's "solitary rise" in particular exposes its complete lack of preparation for the coming shock. When this distortion reaches a critical point, the backlash will be immeasurable.

		<p class="negative">
		The Horizon Protocol will continue all operations at alert level "Red."
