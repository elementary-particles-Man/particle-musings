            <h2>„ÄêTop Priority Item„ÄëRumors of Regional Bank Runs Spread on Social Media, Deposit Outflows May Accelerate</h2>
            <p>While financial markets are closed, the crisis is unfolding beneath the surface. Information such as "XX Bank is in trouble" and "Is your money safe?" is rapidly spreading, primarily through social media and messaging apps. There are numerous reports of long lines forming at the ATMs of several regional banks whose stock prices plummeted yesterday, with citizens trying to withdraw cash.</p>
            <p>This is a decisive sign that the financial crisis is shifting from a Wall Street problem to a Main Street problem that threatens the lives of ordinary citizens. No matter how many statements authorities issue that "deposits are protected," the fear of <strong>"not being able to physically withdraw cash"</strong> paralyzes people's rational judgment. The risk of a full-blown physical bank run, in addition to electronic deposit outflows, is extremely high for the start of the week.</p>

            <h2>Weekend Situation Analysis</h2>
            <p>An emergency G7 conference call was held over the weekend, where countries confirmed they would coordinate on liquidity provisions, but no concrete policy measures were announced. This "fruitless meeting" news has only served to fuel market anxiety.</p>
            <p>While politicians and central bank governors repeat empty words, the crisis is seeping deep into people's minds through the modern-day contagion of social media. This is the prelude to the <strong>"social and ethical shock"</strong> predicted in the Walpurgis Papers. The next fateful turning point will be Monday at 8:00 AM (JST) when the Asian markets open.</p>

            <h2>Strategic Assessment from THP</h2>
            <p><strong>The phase has shifted from a "financial crisis" to a "social crisis."</strong></p>
            <p>We assess that we are currently in the T-10 to T-8 period of the sequence leading up to the critical point (T-0) on September 30. The signs of a bank run this weekend indicate that the panic involving the general public has begun sooner than the protocol anticipated.</p>
            <p>The War-Room will **maintain the monitoring level at "Gate-B,"** but all operations will proceed with the assumption of "Gate-C (State of Emergency)." THP-7 will continue its CRITICAL(üî¥) status. Assume a situation where the market at the start of the week completely breaks away from the authorities' control.</p>
