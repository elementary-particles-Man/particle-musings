		<h2>
		[Special Note] Confirmation of Broad Dollar Weakness and Determination of a Singularity Point
		</h2>
		<p>
		Today's USD/JPY rate of 138.55 is an anomaly that deviates from the range of the past few months and is statistically determined to be a **Singularity Point**. This is not a one-off appreciation of the yen.
		</p>
		<p>
		As shown in the table above, the dollar has fallen against other major currencies such as the euro (EUR) and the pound (GBP). The US Dollar Index (DXY), which provides an integrated view of this, has also plummeted, clearly confirming that today's event is a **global "capital flight from the dollar."**
		</p>
		<p>
		The subprime auto loan problem that emerged over the weekend and the inaction of the US authorities in response have finally begun to undermine confidence in the reserve currency, the dollar itself. The market is beginning to see this not as a "problem of a specific sector in the US," but as a "problem of the credit of the United States as a nation."

		Market Overview and Analysis
		</h2>
		<h3>
		Spreading Distrust, the Verdict of the Tokyo Market After the Holidays
		</h3>
		<p>
		The market on September 16 was extremely nervous, with the after-effects of the "Black Monday" avoidance of the previous day and the reaction of the Tokyo market after the holidays intersecting. As capital flight from the dollar became clear, each market reacted to this global erosion of confidence in its own context.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Tokyo market plummets on selling to secure liquidity:
			</strong>
			The crash of the Nikkei Stock Average on this day cannot be explained solely by "concerns about export companies due to the strong yen." The essence was a panic selling aimed at **"securing liquidity in the yen currency"** caused by the global capital flight from the dollar. As global investors dumped their dollar assets and fled to the yen, which was considered the only safe-haven asset, their yen currency on hand was depleted. They were forced to sell the most liquid Japanese stocks (especially Nikkei average constituent stocks) regardless of their value in order to secure yen funds urgently. This is not a "sell-off of Japan," but a structural market distortion that occurred as a result of the ultimate "yen buying."
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Tug-of-war in the US market and tolerance of a weak dollar:
			</strong>
			The Dow Jones Industrial Average rebounded slightly, but this is nothing more than a dead cat bounce from the previous day's sharp fall. The decline in the S&amp;P 500 shows that market sentiment is still leaning towards risk-off. The stock prices of financial institutions considered to be the epicenter of the problem, such as JPMorgan Chase and Barclays, continued to fall. There are signs that the authorities are de facto tolerating a weak dollar, which may be further accelerating the flight from the dollar.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Silent authorities, deepening suspicion:
			</strong>
			The specific rescue measures and statements from the FRB and the US Treasury that the market is most looking for are still not forthcoming. Only the clich√© "we are monitoring the situation" is repeated, and this silence is amplifying market anxiety. In particular, concerns about the deterioration of the balance sheets of primary dealers are rapidly spreading under the surface.
		</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
		Strategic Assessment from THP
		</h2>
		<p>
		Today's market trends indicate that the crisis has entered a new phase, namely the entrance to the **collapse of confidence in the reserve currency, the dollar**. Although panic selling has been temporarily avoided, it does not mean that the storm has passed. Rather, market participants have regained their composure and have begun to quietly assess **"which currency will survive to the end."**
		</p>
		<p>
		In our analysis, the epicenter of the risk has clearly shifted from subprime auto loan ABS to the primary dealers who underwrote and funded them. The entire market's suspicion is beginning to focus on whether they can survive the huge US Treasury auction on September 30.
		</p>
		<p>
		From an information warfare perspective, a narrative may be formed to trivialize this as a domestic issue of "a sharp appreciation of the yen." We must continue to point out that this is a global problem caused by the fiscal structure of the United States itself, namely the **collapse of confidence in the dollar**.
