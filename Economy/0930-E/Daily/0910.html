		Summary: The World Disconnected. Is the "Lonely Enthusiasm" of the Japanese Market a Prelude to Collapse?
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		On September 10, the global markets were
		<strong>
			fatally "disconnected"
		</strong>
		between those who completely ignored the warning lit by the harbinger of Walpurgis and those who quietly braced themselves for its pressure. While the Japanese market updated its historical high based on the political situation, the US market showed nervous movements due to fears of inflation, and the world's steps are in complete disarray.
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		<strong>
			Gold, a testament to the distrust of fiat currencies, remains in the abnormally high range of the $3,600s
		</strong>
		, silently telling how fragile this superficial calm is. This is not the calm before the storm. The energy for collapse continues to accumulate in the market in a very distorted form.

		<h2>
		Major Market Trends
		</h2>
		<h3>
		1. Japanese Market: A Dangerous Festival, Detached from Reality
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The Nikkei Stock Average continued to rise sharply by
		<strong>
			+0.87%
		</strong>
		, updating its all-time high to
		<strong>
			43,837.67 yen
		</strong>
		. This is supported by a very domestic and unsubstantiated narrative of expectations for fiscal stimulus by the next administration following the announcement of the prime minister's resignation. This "lonely enthusiasm," which does not factor in any global credit contraction risk, is not a safe haven for global funds, but is rather becoming a prime short target.
		</p>
		<h3>
		2. US Market: Nervous Developments. The Looming Shadow of Inflation
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		Although the S&amp;P 500 rose slightly by
		<strong>
			+0.48%
		</strong>
		, this is not something to be optimistic about. The market is in a complete wait-and-see mood ahead of the upcoming release of inflation indicators (PPI/CPI). The market's tendency to be swayed by individual corporate news is evidence that the market as a whole has no clear direction, and exposes its vulnerability to a shock if inflation remains high.
		</p>
		<h3>
		3. European Market: A Lull, but Structural Problems Remain Unchanged
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		Major European indexes also saw slight gains, but none of the fundamental problems have been resolved. Italy's fiscal concerns and France's political risks continue to smolder, and the ECB has no effective measures left to take. The current stability is merely a postponement of the problem.
		</p>
		<h3>
		4. Chinese Market: Limited Rebound
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The Shanghai Composite Index rose slightly by
		<strong>
			+0.13%
		</strong>
		. Although the decline was halted by expectations for the government's fragmented economic measures, the structural weight of the real estate market crisis has not been removed, and the situation is far from a self-sustaining recovery.

		<h2>
		Key Indicators: A Silent Warning
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		The fact that the price of gold remains above $3,500 most eloquently speaks to the distortion in this market. The low and stable price of crude oil reflects concerns about a slowdown in the global economy. On the other hand, the dollar-yen is stuck at a historically weak level, indicating that the "enthusiasm" of the Japanese market is based on the foundation of the depreciation of its own currency's value.

		<h2 class="negative">
		Conclusion: The Countdown Accelerates
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		The disconnect in the market suggests that the coming shock will hit the world asymmetrically. In particular, the vulnerability of the Japanese market, which continues to rise solely on domestic expectations while turning a blind eye to global reality, is at an extremely dangerous level.
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		The gears of Walpurgis are steadily turning. When this distortion collapses, the backlash will be on an unprecedented scale.
