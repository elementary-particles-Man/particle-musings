            <h2>Summary: The Ghost of Inflation Attacks the Market. Japan's Optimism is on the Brink.</h2>
            <p>
                On September 11, the event that the market feared most occurred. The announced US Consumer Price Index (CPI) exceeded market expectations, once again proving the deep-rootedness of inflation. This blow completely shattered expectations of a rate cut by the FRB, and global stock markets were hit by a broad decline.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this global risk-off trend, only the Japanese market finished trading before the CPI announcement and continued to rise, relying on the small rebound in the US market the previous day. However, this <strong class="negative">"lonely high," completely disconnected from the reality of the world,</strong> is no longer a celebration, but a dangerous sign on the edge of a cliff of collapse. Funds that sensed fear fled to safe-haven assets, and <strong class="negative">gold broke through $3,700</strong>. The true sentiment of the market lies here.

            <h2>Major Market Trends</h2>

            <h3>1. US Market: <span class="negative">Broad decline due to inflation shock</span></h3>
            <p>
                The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply by <strong class="negative">-1.8%</strong>, and the S&P 500 by <strong class="negative">-2.1%</strong>. In response to the higher-than-expected CPI, the market has begun to fully price in a "Higher for Longer" interest rate scenario. The expectation of a "soft landing" that had supported the market until now has completely disappeared, and the fear of a recession has taken over the market.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Japanese Market: <span class="negative">A dangerous high that is unaware of the global crisis</span></h3>
            <p>
                The Nikkei Stock Average finished trading before the US CPI announcement, rising for the third consecutive day to the <span class="positive">44,150 yen level</span>, marking a new all-time high for consecutive days. However, this is a movement that is completely opposite to the global sentiment, and futures plummeted in after-hours trading. As the yen weakened further, approaching <strong class="negative">149 yen to the dollar</strong>, it was revealed how fragile this stock market rally is.
            </p>

            <h3>3. European Market: <span class="negative">Decline in the aftermath of US inflation</span></h3>
            <p>
                In response to the US CPI announcement, major European indexes also fell across the board. The fact that an FRB rate cut is now further away is also a negative for the European economy, and it has taken on the appearance of a global stock market crash. Tech and real estate stocks, which are particularly vulnerable to rising interest rates, were sold off.
            </p>
            
            <h3>4. Chinese Market: <span class="negative">Unchanged stagnation</span></h3>
            <p>
                The Shanghai Composite Index fell slightly. Domestic real estate problems and concerns about an economic slowdown remain strong, and the global risk-off trend is also a weight, so the market continues to be top-heavy.

            </div>
            <p>
                The surge in gold prices clearly shows the distrust of fiat currencies and the flight of funds from the stock market. On the other hand, crude oil prices are falling due to concerns about a recession. The dollar-yen is approaching the 149 yen level as the yen is sold further due to expectations of a widening interest rate differential between Japan and the US. This highlights the fact that Japan's stock market rally is at the expense of the depreciation of its own currency's value.

            <h2 class="negative">Conclusion: The Beginning of the End</h2>
            <p>
                The inflation shock of September 11 marked the "end" of the optimistic scenario that had dominated the market until now. And it means that the countdown to the "beginning" of Walpurgis has entered its final stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The distortion of the Japanese market, which has turned a blind eye to the reality of the world and has updated its lonely high, has already passed its critical point. When this disconnect is corrected, the impact will be immeasurable.
