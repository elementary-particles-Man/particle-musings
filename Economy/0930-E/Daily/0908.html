		The basis for judgment: The sudden rise in "financial money" is the biggest warning
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		As the term "an emergency gold," gold prices often rise in response to emergencies such as wars and large-scale conflicts. However, this time, no such clear emergency occurred around the world. Despite this, it recorded such a huge price increase (1 ounce = over $3,500). This situation is extremely unnatural and cannot be explained by individual economic events.
		<strong>
			That is why we consider the "a harbinger of Walpurgis" to be fired with the alarm bell that echoed in this silence.

		September 8, 2025: Observed objective facts
		</h2>
<p>
		The extraordinary rise in gold was the manifestation of structural distortions deeply etched in each market. Below, we will record the movements of the day based solely on the objective facts observed.
		</p>
<h3>
		1. US market: face the reality of the economy and risk-off
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		On September 8, the US stock market closed down significantly, taking into account the worsening fundamentals of the economy, following employment statistics that were significantly lower than market forecasts released last weekend. The move shows that concerns about an economic slowdown have become a common perception of markets that cannot be ignored.
		</p>
<h3 class="negative">
		2. Japanese market: The danger of "doppo-taku" isolated from the world
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		On the same day, the Japanese market was pushing back against the global trend of risk-off, rising due to narratives against the backdrop of domestic political expectations. This is an extremely peculiar phenomenon that deviates from the reality of the global economy and encompasses structural vulnerabilities. The coexistence of a escapism to gold and a weaker yen suggests an extreme distortion in the market.
		</p>
<h3>
		3. European market: continued weakness
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		The European market was also forced to move softly due to concerns about the US-born economic slowdown and concerns about the monetary system. (Reference: Gemini DeepResearch Report

		Conclusion: Historical turning point
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		On September 8, 2025, each market showed a different appearance. However, there is one truth that underlies this.
		<strong>
			Gold price exceeds $3,500 per ounce
		</strong>
		This fact is a historic turning point that shows that market confidence in the traditional currency system has been decisively damaged.
		</p>
<p class="negative">
		The United States faces reality and enters a phase of adjustment, and Japan is isolated in dangerous optimism. This asymmetry will amplify the destructive power of the upcoming "Walpurgis body."
		</p>
<p class="negative">
		The Horizon Protocol takes this signal solemnly and shifts all operations to the "red" alert level. There is little time left.
