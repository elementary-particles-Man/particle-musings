			Summary: Black Monday Averted, But the Real Crisis Has Begun
		</h2>
		<p>
			The predicted Black Monday was narrowly averted. With the Japanese market closed for a holiday, the world's attention turned to Europe and then the US market. The European markets opened with sharp declines across the board, and the US market, which inherited that trend, also fell sharply. However, towards the close, buybacks came in on expectations of "some kind of intervention by central banks," and a catastrophic crash was avoided. This is not a cause for relief. The market's attention was focused on the subprime auto loan problem that was exposed over the weekend, especially the primary dealers at its core. The stock prices of JPMorgan and Barclays plummeted, and their CDS spreads, which indicate their credit risk, widened sharply. The market has begun to price in not the failure of individual companies, but the deterioration of the "plumbing" of the entire financial system. Catastrophe was avoided, but it was a day when the countdown definitely moved to the next stage.

		<h3>
			Observations and Analysis: A Battle on Thin Ice
		</h3>
		<p>
			The biggest factor in averting Black Monday was the expectation of an "invisible hand" from central banks. Market participants partially refrained from panic selling in anticipation that the FRB and ECB would take some liquidity supply measures. However, this is merely a postponement of the problem. It cannot be denied that the closure of the Tokyo market may have acted as a temporary breakwater to stop the chain of panic in Asian time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The essential problem is that the scale of losses in the subprime auto loan ABS market is completely invisible. It has been pointed out that the "double pledging" of Tricolor may be rampant among other operators, and the market is in a state of suspicion. Until the losses are confirmed, the stock prices of financial institutions will be forced to trade with a heavy top.
		</p>
		<p>
			According to our signal analysis, the most noteworthy thing is the movement of the CDS spreads of primary dealers. As long as this figure continues to rise, it will be difficult for them to fulfill their original role in US Treasury auctions.
			<strong>
			The focus of the market is no longer on the good or bad of the economy. It has shifted to the root of national credit: "Will US Treasuries continue to be issued without failure?"
