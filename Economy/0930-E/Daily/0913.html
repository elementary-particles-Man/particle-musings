                Walpurgis perspective: The tech-led rally and weakness in other sectors suggest an uneven distribution of liquidity. Given the confirmed failure of the 9/30 US Treasury primary auction, stress indicators in the short-term market, such as auction supply and demand, GC repo, and FRA-OIS, are likely to worsen.

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>
                The indexes are polarized. From a Walpurgis perspective, the longer the tech rally continues, the higher the risk that the vulnerability of government bond supply and demand and the tightening of short-term funds will be exposed. Be wary of a pullback in interest rates and liquidity after the FOMC.
