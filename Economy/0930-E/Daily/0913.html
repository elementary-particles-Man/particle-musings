		Walpurgis's perspective: Tech-led rise and weaknesses in other sectors suggest an uneven distribution of liquidity. Given the failure of the US Treasury primary on September 30th (confirmed), the area is likely to exacerbate short-term market stress indicators, such as bid supply and demand, GC reporting, and FRA-OIS.

<section class="conclusion">
<h2>
		Findings
		</h2>
<p>
		The index is polarized. From Walpurgis's perspective, the more high tech continues, the higher the risk that the weakness in government bond supply and demand and the tightness of short-term funds will be exposed. Be careful of the reversal of interest rates and liquidity after the FOMC.
