			Summary: The Market is Closed, and the Gates of Hell are Opening
		</h2>
		<p>
			Sunday, September 14. The world's financial markets are closed, and there is no movement in the numbers. However, this silence is nothing but the eerie calm before the storm. Over the weekend, the structural corruption that had been taking place in the depths of the US subprime auto loan market was brought to our desk by multiple DRs (Decision Requests). This is irrefutable evidence that the alchemy of "securitization," reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, is once again eating away at the entire system. Market participants are holding their breath for the market to open on Monday. The return of Black Monday is no longer mere speculation.

		<h3>
			New Firestorms That Emerged Over the Weekend
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<strong>
				The collapse of Tricolor and allegations of double pledging:
			</strong>
			Major subprime auto loan company Tricolor Holdings has collapsed. Behind this, there are allegations of malicious fraud of "double pledging," in which the same asset is pledged as collateral to multiple financial institutions. Information is circulating that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Contamination to the core of the financial system:
			</strong>
			The root of this problem lies in the serious conflict of interest in which giant investment banks such as JPMorgan and Barclays are both lenders of "warehouse lines" and also the lead underwriters of ABS (asset-backed securities) that bundle and securitize those loans. They create risk and sell that risk to the world.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Déjà vu of 2008:
			</strong>
			This structure is exactly the same as the CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) that caused the subprime mortgage crisis. The fraud of a single company is developing into a situation that shakes the trust of the entire financial system through the process of securitization.
			</li>

		<h3>
			Observations and Analysis
		</h3>
		<p>
			According to our analysis, the collapse of this subprime auto loan ABS market dramatically increases the probability of "Walpurgis (failure of the US Treasury primary auction)" on September 30. This is because JPMorgan and Barclays are also primary dealers who are ultimately obligated to underwrite US Treasuries.
		</p>
		<p>
			Huge losses in the ABS market will directly hit their balance sheets and deprive them of the capacity to underwrite US Treasuries. The
			<strong>
			"auto-sovereign doom loop"
			</strong>
			—a nightmare chain in which auto loan defaults destroy national credit (sovereign debt)—has become a real possibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no certainty that Black Monday will occur on 0915. However, it is certain that Pandora's box was opened this weekend when the market was closed.
