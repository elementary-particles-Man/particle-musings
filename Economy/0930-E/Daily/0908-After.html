		[Record of Judgment Process] Regarding the Emergency Statement in the Early Morning of September 8 and Its Aftermath
		</h2>
		<p class="positive">
		Prior to this analysis record, we would like to report and apologize that the emergency statement we released in the early morning of September 8 (
		<a href="./0908-Before.html">
			<strong>
			Emergency Statement: Final Notice of the Collapse of the "Dollar Safety Myth"
			</strong>
		</a>
		) was, as a result, a "failed prediction."
		</p>
		<p>
		The statement was created based on a report of abnormal market fluctuations observed by AI (Gemini) in after-hours trading. However, subsequent verification has revealed that the information that triggered this was a false report due to an AI hallucination.
		</p>
		<p class="positive">
		This incident has served as a valuable lesson on the importance of risk management in collaboration with AI.

			However, apart from the failed prediction above, we have observed an extremely important phenomenon through the market movements on September 8 that should be regarded as a harbinger of Walpurgis.

		This article analyzes the cross-checked objective "facts" and preserves them as the official record of THP.

		Basis for Judgment: The surge in "gold without a crisis" is the biggest alarm bell
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		As the phrase "gold in times of crisis" suggests, the price of gold usually rises in response to the outbreak of emergencies such as wars and large-scale conflicts. However, this time, no such clear emergency has occurred in the world. Nevertheless, it has recorded such an extremely large price increase (over $3,500 per ounce). This situation is remarkably unnatural and can no longer be explained by individual economic events.
		<strong>
			That is why we consider the alarm bell that rang in this silence to be the ignition of the "harbinger of Walpurgis."

		September 8, 2025: Observed Objective Facts
		</h2>
		<p>
		The abnormal surge in gold was an expression of the structural distortions deeply embedded in each market. The following is a record of the day's movements based solely on observed objective facts.
		</p>
		<h3 class="negative">
		US Market: Facing Economic Reality and Moving to Risk-Off
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		On September 8, the US stock market accurately priced in the deterioration of economic fundamentals in response to the employment statistics released at the end of last week, which were significantly below market expectations, and ended the day with a sharp decline. This movement shows that concerns about an economic slowdown have become a common market perception that can no longer be ignored.
		</p>
		<h3 class="negative">
		Japanese Market: The Danger of "Soaring Alone," Isolated from the World
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		On the same day, the Japanese market went against the global risk-off trend and rose on a narrative based on domestic political expectations. This is an extremely unusual phenomenon that is detached from the reality of the global economy and contains structural vulnerabilities. The coexistence of a flight to gold and a weaker yen suggests extreme market distortion.
		</p>
		<h3 class="negative">
		European Market: Continued Softness
		</h3>
		<p class="negative">
		The European market was also forced into a soft trend due to concerns about an economic slowdown originating in the US and anxiety about the currency system.

		Summary: The Clock Has Started Ticking
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		On September 8, 2025, each market showed a different face. However, the underlying truth is one. The fact that the
		<strong>
			price of gold exceeded $3,500 per ounce
		</strong>
		is a historic turning point that shows that the market's trust in the conventional currency system has been decisively undermined.
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		The United States is facing reality and entering an adjustment phase, while Japan is isolated in a precarious optimism. This asymmetry will amplify the destructive power of the coming "Walpurgis itself."
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		The Horizon Protocol solemnly accepts this signal and shifts all operations to alert level "Red." There is little time left.
