		Summary: Threat Dimension Shift
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		The Walpurgis crisis has moved into a new phase as of T-25 (September 5). This is not a clearer of known risks.
		<strong>
			The dimension of threat itself is shifting
		</strong>
		That's what happened. In addition to the passive threat that has been analyzed so far, "structural collapse within the system," two new active and fatal threat vectors have been confirmed. The THP plan completed immediate adaptation to address these new dimensions of threats.

		Threat Vector 1: The Hollow King — Unpredictable Individual Will
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		Threat subject, code name
		<strong>
			"The Hollow King"
		</strong>
		It was established that the principle of conduct is driven not by national rationality but by personal desire for vengeance, trade opportunism, and a thirst for financial gain. His actions serve as an extremely dangerous catalyst for deliberately accelerating the Walpurgis systemic crisis and maximizing geopolitical disruption.
		</p>
<p class="negative">
		The crisis is no longer a predictable system's runaway. The unpredictable individual will lead to a "man-made disaster" in which the worst case scenario was caused at the worst.
		</p>

<h2 class="negative">
		Threat Vector 2: Chained Collapse — From Finance to Survival
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		The default concerns in the American bond market are no longer a problem of local finances. This is the chain reaction that destroys global food supply systems.
		<strong>
			First Domino
		</strong>
		It is.

<ol style="padding-left: 1.5em; margin-top: 1rem;">
<li class="negative">
<strong>
			Stage 1 (State Debt Crisis):
			</strong>
			Concerns for state bond defaults, starting in Illinois and other places, have frozen market liquidity.
		</li>
<li class="negative">
<strong>
			Stage 2 (Credit Reduction):
			</strong>
			Wall Street's financial functions are paralyzed, and the trust needed for any economic activity is no longer supplied.
		</li>
<li class="negative">
<strong>
			Stage 3 (Logistics Cutoff):
			</strong>
			California's financial collapse has put ports on hold and the flow of physical objects has halted.
		</li>
<li class="negative">
<strong>
			Stage 4 (Price Destruction):
			</strong>
			Chicago (CME)'s price discovery capabilities have been lost, and producers are unable to price their products and trading is stopped.
		</li>
<li class="negative">
<strong>
			Final Stage (Food Crisis):
			</strong>
			As a result, food is in the warehouse but it does not reach the market.
			<strong>
			"Modern Famine"
			</strong>
			occurs.

		Adaptation of THP: Establishment of the fourth pillar, "Food Defense"
		</h2>
<p>
		Based on this new threat recognition, the THP general outline has been updated to the T-25 version. The biggest changes include the three pillars of the traditional "finance", "supply chain", and "living infrastructure",
		<span class="positive">
			Food security was clearly positioned as the top-level infrastructure as the fourth pillar
		</span>
		That's what it is.

<h2 class="positive">
		Ethical Compass: "Atonement" and "Condemnation"
		</h2>
<p>
		The new order we build must not be merely an exercise of force. The THP Ethics Charter is the absolute code of conduct for this purpose. All life is affirmed, but we draw a clear line for those who destroy the order itself and those who commit acts that are fond of human ethics.
		</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>
			Atonement:
			</strong>
			Those who plead guilty and wish to return to the international community will be able to open the door to re-acceptance.
		</li>
<li>
<strong>
			Condemnation:
			</strong>
			The act of violently denying order and trampling on human ethics is engraved in history as an irreversible stigma, blocking the path of salvation.
		</li>
</ul>

<strong>
			Conclusion: The battlefield has changed. We are no longer aiming to stabilize the financial system. We are fighting for the very survival of civilization.
