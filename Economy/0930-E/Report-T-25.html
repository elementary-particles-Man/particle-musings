		Summary: A Shift in the Dimension of the Threat
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		As of T-25 (September 5), the Walpurgis crisis has entered a new phase. This is not a clarification of known risks.
		<strong>
			The dimension of the threat itself has shifted.
		</strong>
		In addition to the passive threat of "structural collapse within the system" that we have analyzed so far, two new active and fatal threat vectors have been identified. The THP plan has completed immediate adaptation to respond to these new dimensional threats.

		Threat Vector 1: "The Hollow King" - The Unpredictable Will of an Individual
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		It has been confirmed that the motive of the threat actor, codenamed
		<strong>
			"The Hollow King,"
		</strong>
		is not driven by national reason, but by personal revenge, transactional opportunism, and a craving for financial gain. His actions will act as an extremely dangerous catalyst to intentionally accelerate the systemic crisis of Walpurgis and maximize geopolitical chaos.
		</p>
		<p class="negative">
		The crisis is no longer a predictable system runaway. It has become a "man-made disaster" in which the worst-case scenario is triggered at the worst possible time by the unpredictable will of an individual.

		Threat Vector 2: A Chain of Collapse - From Finance to Survival
		</h2>
		<p class="negative">
		The concern over defaults in the US state bond market is no longer a matter of local government finance. It is the
		<strong>
			first domino
		</strong>
		in a chain reaction that will destroy the global food supply system.
		</p>
		<ol style="padding-left: 1.5em; margin-top: 1rem;">
		<li class="negative">
			<strong>
			Stage 1 (State Bond Crisis):
			</strong>
			Concerns over state bond defaults, starting with states like Illinois, will freeze market liquidity.
		</li>
		<li class="negative">
			<strong>
			Stage 2 (Credit Contraction):
			</strong>
			The financial functions of Wall Street will be paralyzed, and the credit necessary for all economic activities will no longer be supplied.
		</li>
		<li class="negative">
			<strong>
			Stage 3 (Logistics Disruption):
			</strong>
			The financial collapse of California will halt port functions, and the physical flow of goods will stop.
		</li>
		<li class="negative">
			<strong>
			Stage 4 (Price Destruction):
			</strong>
			The price discovery function of Chicago (CME) will be lost, producers will be unable to price their own products, and transactions will cease.
		</li>
		<li class="negative">
			<strong>
			Final Stage (Food Crisis):
			</strong>
			As a result, a
			<strong>
			"modern famine"
			</strong>
			will occur, in which there is food in warehouses but it does not reach the market.

		THP's Adaptation: Establishment of the Fourth Pillar, "Food Defense"
		</h2>
		<p>
		Based on this new threat perception, the THP general framework has been updated to the T-25 version. The biggest change is that in addition to the three conventional pillars of "finance," "supply chain," and "living infrastructure,"
		<span class="positive">
			"food security" has been clearly positioned as the highest-level infrastructure as the fourth pillar.
		</span>

		Ethical Compass: "Atonement" and "Condemnation"
		</h2>
		<p>
		The new order we are building must not be a mere exercise of power. The THP Ethical Charter is the absolute code of conduct for that purpose. All life is affirmed, but a clear line is drawn against those who destroy the order itself and those who commit acts contrary to humanity.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Atonement:
			</strong>
			For those who admit their guilt and wish to return to the international community, the gate of re-acceptance will be opened.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Condemnation:
			</strong>
			Acts that violently deny order and trample on humanity will be carved into history as an irreversible stigma, and the path to salvation will be closed.
		</li>
		</ul>

		<strong>
			Conclusion: The battlefield has changed. We are no longer aiming to stabilize the financial system. We are fighting for the survival of civilization itself.
