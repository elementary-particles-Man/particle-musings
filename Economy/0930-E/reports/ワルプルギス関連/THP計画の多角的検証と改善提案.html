      The Horizon Protocol: Strategic Review and Ideal for the Walpurgis Crisis
     </strong>
    </h1>
    <h2 id="i-the-horizon-protocol戦略的必須要件">
     <strong>
      I. Executive Summary: Strategic Essential Requirements for The Horizon Protocol
     </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
     This report examines the Horizon Protocol (THP) plan from a variety of angles, and presents areas for improvement in the Walpurgis Crisis scenario, a systematic financial crisis that began with the failure of US Treasury bids on September 30, 2025. The Walpurgis crisis is not a periodic downturn in markets, but rather a global financial architecture built since 2008.
     <strong>
      構造的破綻
     </strong>
     It must be understood as The essence of this crisis lies in the weaponization of financial interconnectivity. In other words, regulatory frameworks designed for the soundness of individual financial institutions (micro-practice), particularly complementary leverage ratios (SLRs) and central clearing institutions (CCPs), will be transformed into devices that amplify systemic risk at the macro level. This is the iatrogenic crisis caused by treatment, and the very solution born from lessons learned in 2008 is the source of new, more serious vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Based on this fundamental threat awareness, THP refinements must place the following three strategic imperatives at the core:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Proactive Resilience
       </strong>
       : Transform the paradigm from post-crisis management to preventive fortification of national balance sheets and domestic financial systems before the crisis occurs. This means not merely diversifying assets, but rather engineeringly increasing the resistance of the "piping" itself in the financial system.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        決定的介入（Decisive Intervention）
       </strong>
       : Develop a toolkit that enables overwhelming and rapid intervention during the "first 72 hours" after the crisis. This intervention will not only reach liquidity in financial markets, but also to maintain the integrity of key supply chains such as trade, food and energy.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Strategic Autonomy
       </strong>
       : Cultivate independent ability to act by circumventing international organizations that may become dysfunctional and forming "mini-lateral" alliances with trusted partners. This is a stablishment to reduce the excessive reliance on the US dollar system on the core infrastructure and ensure leadership in the new international financial order.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Based on these strategic essential requirements, this report rigorously evaluates the supposed components of the THP in comparison with the specific collapse mechanism of the Walpurgis crisis. It also proposes concrete and viable improvements, including the integration of financial planning and national security, the creation of alternative payment mechanisms, and the advance approval of legal authority in emergencies. The goal of THP is not simply to survive a crisis, but to emerge as a more resilient and autonomous nation after it, and to play a leading role in the formation of the next international order.
    </p>

     <strong>
      II. Dismantling the Walpurgis Crisis: Multi-domain Threat Assessment
     </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Walpurgis crisis is not a single financial shock, but a complex threat that links and amplifies financial, geopolitics, operations and humanitarian aspects. In order to effectively refine THP, it is essential to accurately understand the multilayered structure of this crisis.
    </p>

     <strong>
      2.1. Financial Core: From non-bidging to systemic liquidity collapse
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     The epicenter of the crisis is the dysfunction of the world's safest asset: the US Treasury market. The collapse process is driven by a precise mechanism.
    </p>
    <h4 id="211-事象米国債入札不成立法医学的分析">
     <strong>
      2.1.1. Trigger events: Forensic analysis of US Treasury bid failure
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The US Treasury bid on September 30, 2025 will not simply be "slow" results. The following multiple important indicators simultaneously break through the crisis threshold, resulting in a "fire event" in which market confidence is completely disrupted 1.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tail ≥ 8–12bp
       </strong>
       : The "tail," which is the difference between the highest winning bid yield and the expected yield in the When-Issued market just before a bid, expands to 8-12bp or more, which corresponds to the 4-6 standard deviation of the normal (1-2bp). This is a critical signal that the final demand at the market expected price has completely disappeared 1.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Bid-to-Cover Ratio ≤ 2.00
       </strong>
       : The bid rate, which indicates the strength of demand, will fall to a level that is significantly below the healthy 2.0. This means that even with mandatory bids from the primary dealer (PD), the offer can only be covered in a barely, meaning that there is a catastrophic lack of demand from practical demand.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Indirect bid share ≤ 50% or PD allocation ≥ 40%
       </strong>
       : The share of indirect bidders, including overseas central banks, has plummeted from the usual 60-65% to below 50%, suggesting capital strikes from overseas. As a result, the "last buyer" PD is forced to take on an allocation of more than 40%, far more than the usual 10-15%. This means that the dealer community will have an indigesible amount of duration risk 1.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Simultaneous breakthroughs of these thresholds pose an unquestionable fact for all market participants that US Treasury has lost its status as a "risk-free asset."
    </p>
    <h4 id="212-第一次増幅器slr">
     <strong>
      2.1.2. Primary Amplifiers: SLR and Primary Dealer Choke Points
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The core mechanism of the crisis is that this early shock is a post-financial crisis regulatory framework, particularly\
     <em>
      None
     </em>
     Complementary leverage ratio (SLR)\
     <em>
      None
     </em>
     It is in the point that it is dramatically amplified by SLR is a capital adequacy regulation that does not take risk into consideration, treating extremely safe US Treasury and high-risk assets on par. As major banks' US Treasury holdings grow, SLRs are becoming the most restrictive capital constraints for many financial institutions, limiting the capacity to expand their balance sheets1.
    </p>
    <p>
     Due to the failure of the bid, the PD unintentionally carries huge amounts of US Treasury stock. This will immediately increase their total leverage exposure, bringing several major banks below the SLR regulatory requirements. As a result, PD will be forced to sell its newly-underwritten U.S. Treasury Treasury in a market with no buyers, in order to reduce its balance sheet, rather than absorbing the shock. PD, which was once a shock absorber in the market, has been transformed into a procyclical (business cycle amplification) existence that amplifies the crisis, thanks to the restrictions of SLR.
    </p>
    <h4 id="213-配管閉塞市場ccp">
     <strong>
      2.1.3. System Piping Blockage: Repo Market and CCP Death Spiral
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The dysfunction of the PD spreads immediately into the financing markets and liquidation systems, the central plumbing of the financial system, creating a self-enhancing and catastrophic chain.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The collapse of the report market
       </strong>
       : PDs with a balance sheet constraint will turn from funding the repo market to huge funding users to finance their positions. This will result in a serious supply and demand shock in the secured funding market, and the collateralized overnight interest rate (SOFR) has risen abnormally at +150-300bp. As the repo market, which is the market's lubricant, becomes dysfunctional, the number of "fail to delivery (FTD)" where securities are not being delivered will explode, causing the entire payment system to become paralyzed 1.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Procyclicality of CCP
       </strong>
       : The sharp drop in U.S. Treasury prices and sudden volatility lead to large-scale, simultaneous margin calls by central clearing bodies (CCPs) such as CMEs (futures) and FICC (physical and repos). CCP's margin model is designed to raise margin requirements in response to rising market volatility and is essentially procyclical 1. This mechanism is reasonable in protecting individual CCPs, but the system as a whole has the catastrophic side effect of sucking up liquidity from the market on a massive scale at the very moment when liquidity is at its most tight.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     As a result, it is forced to sell the most liquid assets (US Treasury) (fire sales) with the aim of securing cash to meet margin calls. This throwback pushes US Treasury prices further down, increasing volatility, which induces further margin calls. This vicious cycle is the true nature of the "fluidity death spiral" 1.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Walpurgis crisis is fundamentally different from the 2008 financial crisis. While the 2008 crisis was caused by a lack of regulation and excessive risk-taking, the Walpurgis crisis was that regulations (SLRs, forced CCP liquidation) introduced to increase the safety of individual financial institutions, stolen and interact with the resilience of the entire system, transforming manageable shocks into catastrophic market collapse.
     <strong>
      Unintended consequences of regulation
     </strong>
     That's why. THP must address not only market panic, but also the very structural paradox of this modern financial system.

     <strong>
      2.2. Global propagation and vulnerability in each country
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     Shock waves generated at the epicenter of the crisis instantly spread across the world through clear routes, exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of each country, causing enormous damage.
    </p>
    <h4 id="221-伝播">
     <strong>
      2.2.1. Propagation Vector: Term Premium Shock and Global Dollar Death Loop
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Term Premium Shock
       </strong>
       : Failure in US Treasury bids is essentially a fundamental reassessment of the price of duration risk. This manifests as the sudden rise in the risk premium, namely the term premium, included in long-term interest rates (over +150bp in the L3 scenario). This single variable is the main vector that propagates the crisis to all other long-term duration assets (equities, corporate bonds, MBS, etc.) around the world. For example, according to the equity duration model, the equity market with a duration of 40 years will suffer a price drop of more than -30% in theory against an interest rate shock of 150bp.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Global Dollar Death Loop
       </strong>
       : Dysfunction in the US repo market causes a serious global US dollar shortage for non-US banks (Eurodollar Systems) that rely heavily on the market for short-term dollar funding. This dollar shortage is observed as a rapid expansion of currency basis swaps1. Foreign financial institutions that have lost access to dollar funds will be forced to sell their most liquid US dollar assets: US Treasury. This selling pressure further pushes US Treasury prices down and creates a vicious cycle (death loop) that exacerbates the early crisis.

      2.3. Geopolitical and operational stress amplification factors
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Walpurgis crisis is more than just a pure financial phenomenon. The deteriorating geopolitical environment and vulnerability of physical infrastructure serve as "amplifiers" that further inflict the crisis.

     <strong>
      2.3.1. Geopolitical damping coefficients
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     During the 2008 financial crisis, rapid international cooperation, centered around the G7/G20, played a critical role in containing the crisis.3. However, the current geopolitical environment is completely different from that of the time. The intensification of the US-China conflict and the more transactional US diplomatic stance significantly lower expectations for international cooperation 7. In particular, the invocation of the Federal Reserve dollar swapline, the most powerful tool against the global dollar shortage, is no longer a technical decision, but a highly political decision. This uncertainty reduces the effectiveness of international support (e.g.
    </p>
    <p>
     γ = 0.75) and THP should not be optimistic about international cooperation 1.

      2.3.2. Operational Risk: The Shadow of Black Swan
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The L3 scenario assumes an exogenous shock of power grid failures in the Chicago/New York Corridor 1. This suggests that physical or cyberattacks could cause the financial system's payment and liquidation infrastructure to physically shut down. Such an operational obstacle is the ultimate amplifier that transforms the financial liquidity crisis into a complete market halt where transactions themselves are impossible 1. It highlights the fact that the entire digital financial system is built on vulnerable physical infrastructure, and THP needs to closely coordinate financial stabilization plans with national-level critical infrastructure protection plans. In this regard, the knowledge of organizations such as the NATO's Cooperative Cyber ​​Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) is extremely important 12.

     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     A global financial collapse inevitably causes paralysis of trade and financial markets.15 This will cut off the international supply chain of essential supplies such as food, medicines and energy, leading to a global humanitarian crisis. As the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) performance shows, conflict and hunger are closely linked, and economic disruption caused by the financial crisis can trigger social unrest and conflict in vulnerable countries20. The THP should also consider the secondary and tertiary impacts of financial shocks on the real economy and people's lives, and include non-financial measures such as securing routes for humanitarian relief supplies in its plans.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ultimate threat posed by the Walpurgis crisis is not merely economic losses. It shakes the very foundation of the world order
     <strong>
      Crisis of national legitimacy
     </strong>
     It is. The collapse of the US-led financial system and subsequent dysfunction of the international community fundamentally destroy trust in the existing international order and the key institutions that support it (Fed, US Treasury Department, IMF). The resulting widespread economic hardship and social unrest can lead to political instability in many countries and, in the worst case, a state collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ultimate tail risk in this context is
     <strong>
      The collapse or inner cleft of nuclear powers
     </strong>
     It is. If state control is lost, it will become extremely difficult to manage nuclear material, ensure the security of nuclear weapons, and maintain command and control systems.23 This realises unprecedented and catastrophic risk scenarios in human history, such as the spread of nuclear material, the use of accidental nuclear weapons, or the occurrence of nuclear facilities in conflict. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has the authority to secure nuclear material, but there are major constraints on the unprecedented situation of the collapse of sovereign states and the ability to effectively intervene in armed conflicts.26 Therefore, THP cannot be allowed to remain pure financial protocols and must be inseparable from national security contingency plans that assume such extreme tail risks.

     In this section, we classify the strategies that THP may contain into four pillars, analyze the vulnerability in light of the threat assessment of the Walpurgis crisis, and present specific improvement measures. This is a "red team" exercise to identify defects in the plan and dramatically improve its effectiveness.

     <strong>
      3.1.1. Assumptions of THP Strategies and Vulnerabilities
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     It is estimated that THP's current plan focuses on traditional approaches, such as gradual diversification of foreign currency reserves, encouraging domestic banks to reduce leverage, and participating in international dialogues such as the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).
    </p>
    <p>
     However, this approach is fatal to the Walpurgis crisis
     <strong>
      Not very
     </strong>
     It is. Firstly, too
     <strong>
      too late
     </strong>
     . It would take several years and virtually impossible to reduce the huge positions of Japan's approximately $1.1 trillion US Treasury without causing a market trembling at a meaningful scale. Secondly, too
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      表層的
     </strong>
     It is. This approach views the problem as an asset allocation problem, but its essence lies in the structural vulnerability of the system. Third,
     <strong>
      Misconstrued the reality
     </strong>
     It's doing it. The country's "external net assets" include a large number of illiquid assets such as direct investment, and there is a risk of overvaluing "fire power" that can be used immediately in a crisis 30.
    </p>
    <h4 id="312-改善案">
     <strong>
      3.1.2. Improvement proposal: "Active Resilience Engineering"
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     It is necessary to shift from passive risk management to "active resilience engineering," which actively designs and builds system resistance.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Reclassifying assets
       </strong>
       : It will require that all assets held by the state be reclassified under the new standard of "crisis response liquidity" rather than accounting value. This will clearly distinguish between highly illiquid direct investments and portfolio investments that can be cashed out immediately, and understand the true amount of funds available to respond to the crisis.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pre-position of collateral
       </strong>
       : Assuming that US Treasury will malfunction as collateral in the event of a crisis, a bilateral agreement will be signed in advance with a central bank of a trusted partner country that will mutually recognize non-dollar assets such as gold, domestic government bonds (JGB), and German government bonds (Bund) as collateral eligible collateral for emergency liquidity swaps. This will create a unique liquidity supply network that breaks away from its dependence on US Treasury.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Overhaul of domestic financial piping
       </strong>
       : The domestic CCP and repo market will be subject to immediate, harsher stress tests than ever before, with the Walpurgis crisis scenario (simultaneous global margin calls, abnormal rise in SOFR) as parameters. Based on the results, specific tools to mitigate the liquidity death spiral will be introduced, such as a counter-cyclical margin system, which adjusts margin rates in response to economic fluctuations.

      3.2.1. Possible THP Strategies and Vulnerabilities
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     In response to the crisis, THP is expected to rely on standard central bank toolkits, including the initiation of domestic liquidity supply facilities, lowering policy interest rates, and requesting Fed access to the dollar swapline.
    </p>
    <p>
     This strategy is
     <strong>
      Fatal dependency
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      The narrowness of the scope
     </strong>
     It has two flaws. First, as mentioned above, dollar swap lines run the risk of delaying or rejecting geopolitical friction, and are tantamount to leaving the fate of a nation to the political judgment of another country.1. Second, liquidity supply in its own currency does not fundamentally solve the global "US dollar shortage" problem, and it has limited effects. Third, this approach focuses solely on stabilizing financial markets, overlooking the fatal threat to the real economy, a concurrent collapse of trade finance.16
    </p>
    <h4 id="322-改善案">
     <strong>
      3.2.2. Improvement plan: "Full Spectrum Dominance"
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     It will adopt a "full spectrum dominance" approach that expands the goal of intervention from merely stabilizing financial markets to maintaining the core functions of the nation (finance, trade, and supply of critical supplies).
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sole Fluidity Bridge
       </strong>
       : Based on the country's abundant foreign currency reserves, it will establish a national emergency loan facility that directly supplies US dollar funds to important domestic financial institutions and core industries. This facility will have legal authority in advance so that the moment you pull a crisis trigger (defined in the monitoring dashboard described below) can be activated immediately without needing parliamentary approval.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Emergency Trade Finance Guarantee Program
       </strong>
       :At the time the crisis arises, an emergency trade finance program will be automatically launched with a government guarantee of 100%. This model is modeled on support measures introduced in countries after the 2008 crisis.15 The aim is to prevent the import of important supplies such as food, pharmaceuticals, and energy parts by taking over trade credit insurance, which private insurance companies refuse to underwrite, through government-affiliated export credit institutions such as Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI).33
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Preparation for Capital Flow Management (CFM)
       </strong>
       : Prepare to immediately implement targeted capital movement regulations to prevent catastrophic capital flight. This includes the specific regulations to prevent speculative short-term capital outflows, as well as the legal system and technical infrastructure to implement them, while maintaining essential channels for transfer of funds related to trade settlements and direct investment.

      3.3.1. Possible THP Strategies and Vulnerabilities

    <p>
     THP will seek international collaborative interventions through existing multilateral frameworks such as the G7 and G20, and will envisage joint statements and pressure the United States to fulfill its responsibility for stabilizing the system.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, this approach
     <strong>
      Not realistic
     </strong>
     . Under extreme circumstances like the Walpurgis crisis, these large forums are highly likely to malfunction and paralyze decision-making due to conflicts of interests, including the US-China conflict.5. Waiting for the consensus of 20 countries will not be able to stop the market collapse.

     <strong>
      3.3.2. Improvement proposal: "Mini Lateralism and Alternative Rails"
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The focus will shift its focus from multilateralism, which can be massively dysfunctional, to small, rapid and reliable "mini-lateralism," and create an "alternative rail" that bypasses the existing US dollar system.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Shin Miyazawa Concept 2.0" initiative
       </strong>
       : Rather than waiting for the G20 agreement, we will conclude a "mini-lateral financial support agreement" that has been negotiated in advance with a small number of trustworthy partner countries that share systemic important and values, such as Japan, India and major EU countries. This is modelled on the "Shin Miyazawa Concept," in which Japan provided large-scale bilateral and regional support at its own discretion, separate from the IMF's framework, during the 1997 Asian currency crisis.34 It will designate governmental financial institutions with legal authority and track record in emergency financing overseas, such as the Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).39
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Starting an alternative payment system
       </strong>
       : As the technical core of this mini-lateral agreement, a plan is to create an emergency launch of a non-dollar international settlement mechanism that completely bypasses the frozen US dollar-denominated correspondence banking system. Specifically, the international payment platform for the central bank digital currency (CBDC) led by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS)\

      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Use of SDR as emergency collateral
       </strong>
       : In a bilateral currency swap agreement between mini-lateral partner countries, the IMF's \
       <em>
        None
       </em>
       Special Drawing Rights (SDR)\
       <em>
        None
       </em>
       stipulates that the use of 48. Although SDRs are an existing international reserve asset, they are not fully utilized and their value is linked to the major currency basket, and can serve as neutral collateral separated from the credit risks of a particular country.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The Walpurgis crisis exposes the vulnerability of the US-led financial order to the ground, and inevitably accelerates the transition of power balance. China will take advantage of this opportunity to strongly promote the internationalization of the yuan and the spread of its own country-led financial infrastructure, such as the yuan cross-border payment system (CIPS) and mBridge.43 Therefore, what THP should aim for is not simply to repair and protect old systems. Rather, this crisis is intended to help build a new, multipolar, resilient international financial architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Strategic Opportunities
     </strong>
     It should be reconsidered as: The "mini-lateralism and alternative rail" approach is not just a defense, but a groundbreaking step for the offensive for the country and its allies to have greater strategic autonomy and take the lead in creating the rules for the next system.

     After the crisis has subsided, THP is likely to assume a passive role in participating in international regulatory reform debates led by the IMF and FSB, providing financial support to developing countries through traditional channels.
    </p>
    <p>
     This approach is
     <strong>
      Waives of initiative
     </strong>
     It's equivalent to doing it. This means that we will once again entrust the reform initiative to the parties who designed the framework that has now collapsed. It also reveals that it is not possible to deal with geopolitical structural changes that are accelerating by the crisis.

       <strong>
        Presenting a proactive regulatory reform agenda
       </strong>
       : In the FSB and G20 situations, they will lead and propose concrete and fundamental reform plans. The pillars of the proposal are (1) to convert SLRs into countercyclical capital regulations that expand and contract in response to the business cycle, (2) to require systemic impact assessments on the CCP's margin model to take into account the liquidity impact on the entire system, and (3) to create a global liquidity backstop facility with advance funding in preparation for the collapse of the CCP.

     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Strategic infrastructure investment
       </strong>
       : Using development financial institutions such as JBIC and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), large-scale infrastructure investment programs will be launched in strategically important regions, including the Indo-Pacific region. This is an extension of the New Miyazawa Initiative 2.0, and aims to reconstruct the physical and digital supply chain into something more resilient and multi-dimensional, not overly dependent on either the US or China.

       : Begin negotiations for an emergency bilateral currency swap agreement with 3 to 5 trusted core partners (e.g. India, the UK, France, Germany, Australia, etc.). The key point of the agreement is to qualify assets other than US bonds (SDR, gold, and domestically-respected government bonds) as collateral. This requires diplomatic efforts, but technically falls within the scope of standard central banking operations.

      V. Conclusion: From Horizon Protocol to a New Global Architecture
     </strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Walpurgis Crisis was built after World War II and for the current international financial order that has been transformed since the Nixon Shock in 1971.
     <em>
      None
     </em>
     Extinction-level event\
     <em>
      None
     </em>
     It is. Viewing this crisis as merely a serious financial shock leads to misunderstanding its true nature. This is the collapse of the order itself, caused by resonance between structural flaws and geopolitical conflicts in the system.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, the refined The Horizon Protocol should not remain a defensive plan to survive the storm. It is for voyages the transition to a new global system that is more complex, multipolar and potentially fragmented.
     <strong>
      Proactive Blueprint
     </strong>
     It must be.
    </p>
    <p>
     The ultimate goal that THP should aim for is not merely "survival." Its ultimate goal is to overcome this unprecedented crisis and establish a solid position as a nation that has secured a leading role in shaping the next, stronger financial architecture. Crisis is not only a threat, but also a unique opportunity to escape the yoke of old order and to envision the future with your own hands. The THP should be a compass for that.
