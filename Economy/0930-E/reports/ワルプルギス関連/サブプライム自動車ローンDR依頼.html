      Hypothesis regarding "Deutsche Bank"
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     The role of the central instigator in this case was not carried out by a single entity;
     <strong>
      JPMorgan Chase
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      Barclays
     </strong>
     It concludes that this was achieved through a major investment bank syndicate, with the focus on the results. These banks were both key funding providers (warehouse lenders) and dual functions of lead underwriters and sales agents for asset-backed securities (ABS). It is this dual function that positions them as a node of risk creation and global spread (nexus), making them functionally equivalent to the investment banks in the 2008 financial crisis. Allegations of due diligence during the warehouse financing stage and ABS's subsequent active marketing efforts constitute the core of this systemic bankruptcy.

      Analysis of "Great Escape"
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     Available evidence suggests that the lead manager's bank was the first to sense fraud. The fact that they restricted trading of Tricolor-related ABS before the full story of the bankruptcy was made public strongly suggests that they have launched defensive measures to mitigate their own risk. This means that they likely have already hedged or sold their most harmful exposures and left the most risky unrated or subordinated tranches in the hands of slower reactions downstream institutional investors.
    </p>
    <h3 id="評価">
     <strong>
      Systemic risk assessment
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
     The initial market response appears to be treating Tricolor's collapse as an idiosyncratic fraud case rather than a sector-wide issue. This can also be seen in the credit spreads of high yield bonds, which are still at tight levels. However, this peace is a serious error price (mispricing) of risk. The real danger is that contagion of mistrust freezes the entire market for issuing subprime automotive loans, cutting off funding to other lenders. The cross risk with "The Night of Valpurgis" is not merely a matter of interest rate competition. This is a fluidity amplifier. Credit shocks from the ABS market can cause flight-to-quality if they clash with US Treasury markets, which are already tight due to mass supply, could lead to a serious liquidity crisis.

     </strong>
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Base case:
       </strong>
       Most of the lead managers avoid losses, and losses concentrate as certain institutional investors (such as asset management companies, insurance companies, etc.) grab the "last old lady." Contagion will be limited to rapid repricing of the subprime automotive loan ABS sector and a temporary freeze on new issuances.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Downside Case:
       </strong>
       It turns out that the "baba" was a systemically important institution such as pension funds and local banks, leading to wider financial instability.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tail risk scenario ("Perfect Storm"):
       </strong>
       The crises of trust spread beyond car loan ABS to other securitized products, in sync with the US Treasury market turmoil at the "Night of Valpurgis." This leads to widespread credit market dysfunction.

      Business Model
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Tricolor adopted an integrated "Buy Here Pay Here" model that consistently inaugurates, finances and servicing subprime car loans. The company's rapid growth was driven by its ability to access capital markets. Since 2022 alone, it has issued approximately $2 billion worth of ABS, and has implemented a total of more than $5 billion in loans. This business model is a typical example of "originate to distribution," which generates large amounts of high-risk loans and sells them to external investors in the form of securitization.
    </p>
    <h4 id="層esg">
     <strong>
      Target group and ESG angle
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The company clearly targeted the "credit invisible" Hispanic communities, including borrowers who do not have a Social Security number. This strategy was packaged under the narrative of "social contributions to the environment, social, and governance) investment, and was certified by the US Treasury as a Regional Development Financial Institution (CDFI). This CDFI certification was more than just a simile of words. It was a pivotal marketing tool and a structural element that allowed banks to invest in Tricolor securities to fulfill their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) obligations. This veil of "social mission" could have underestimated risk for investors and regulators.

    <h4 id="根本的問題">
     <strong>
      The fundamental problem
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     However, behind this positive story, compliance issues were frequent. Tricolor has previously settled with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Furthermore, a 2022 investigative report by Barons magazine raised serious questions about the company's lending practices and the quality of the vehicles it sells. These facts suggest that there was structural vulnerability in the company's compliance regime and operations even before its final collapse.

      B. Anatomy of alleged fraud: The collapse of double collateral
     </strong>
    </h3>
    <h4 id="核心的疑惑">
     <strong>
      The core doubt
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The core of the allegations being investigated by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) is that the same group of car loans were being handed over multiple warehouse lenders simultaneously as collateral (double collateral). This is the most basic contraindication in secured finance, and implies a fatal dysfunction in both internal control within Tricolor and external verification processes through loan transactions.
    </p>
    <h4 id="管理体制崩壊">
     <strong>
      The collapse of the management system
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     A statement by Fifth Third Bank CEO Tim Spence speaks to the seriousness of the problem. "Based on our continued investigation, there appears to be material fraud in the collateral submitted to support the borrowing base in all warehouse facilities, as well as the company's audited financial statements." This statement suggests that the fraud could have been organized, not just a single collateral file, but also an entire corporate financial reporting, indicating that the following management structure had completely collapsed:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Servicing Management and Custodian Auditing:
       </strong>
       The securitization system assumes that accurate loan-level data, including vehicle identification numbers (VINs), is closely tracked and managed by custodians. The double collateral was made, which means that this basic verification process either failed or was intentionally avoided.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Warehouse Render Due Diligence:
       </strong>
       Warehouse renderers such as JPMorgan, Fifth Third and Barclays are the first line of defense to prevent fraud. Their failure to see through this double collateral allegation reveals a serious flaw in their company's risk management protocols.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     This series of bankruptcies shows how fundamental risk management has been neglected behind the rapid growth of socially-based companies. The "certification" of CDFI may have rather dulled the sense of vigilance of inherent operational and fraud risks, creating a kind of moral hazard. In other words, the narrative of a company's mission has overshadowed the most fundamental financial due diligence of confirming the physical presence of collateral.

      TAST Deal Structure

    </h4>
    <p>
     Tricolor consolidated the loans it originated into a vehicle called the Tricolor Auto Securitization Trust (TAST) and securitized them. Cases such as TAST 2025-1 ($328 million) and TAST 2025-2 ($217 million) have a structure divided into multiple tranches, and credit enhancement was achieved using methods such as overcollectivation, subordinated debt supplementation, cash reserve accounts, and excess spreads.

     <strong>
      Key stakeholders
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Several specialized agencies were involved in this securitization process.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Originator and Servicer:

       Tricolor Auto Acceptance, LLC. Responsible for originating and managing loans.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Backup Servicer:
       </strong>
       Vervent, Inc. It will take on the role of taking over the servicer operations if Tricolor defaults. The role after bankruptcy will become extremely important.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trustee:
       </strong>
       Wilmington Trust. A trust bank that represents the interests of investors in ABS trusts.

       <strong>
        Rating Company:

       Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), Moody's, and S\&amp;P had given ratings for each case. These institutions are currently reviewing all related ratings in a direction of downgrading.

    </ul>
    <h4 id="担保資産質">
     <strong>
      Quality of collateral assets
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The quality of the securitized loan pool was extremely risky. For example, the collateral assets in TAST 2025-2 have a weighted average FICO score of just 600, which is surprising
     <strong>
      62% of borrowers had no credit scores at all
     </strong>
     . The core of this scheme was to convert assets with such extremely high risk characteristics into investment grade products using the financial engineering of securitization. However, if there was fraud in the underlying collateral assets, then this whole structure would have been a tower on the sand.

      Key players and their exposures
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     JPMorgan Chase, Fifth Third Bancorp and Barclays were the leading warehouse lenders to initial funding for Tricolor's loan origination. These banks have large and roughly equal exposure, with each bank facing a potential loss of around $200 million from this credit line. Regional banks such as Origin Bank, Renasant Bank and Triumph Bank also had exposure, but the size was relatively small.
    </p>
    <h4 id="失敗">
     <strong>
      Due diligence failure
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Warehouse facilities are the first place to which collateral is submitted and are located at the top of the financial supply chain. The double collateral that is believed to have occurred here means a fundamental failure of due diligence in this early stage. These sophisticated financial institutions with a wide range of risk management departments have failed to implement or enforce sufficient management systems to detect the classical method of collateral fraud. This raises serious questions about whether the pursuit of fee revenue and market share in the profitable subprime automotive loan market has led to the relaxation of basic risk management standards.

      Syndicate

    </h4>
    <p>
     The same banking group, centered around JPMorgan and Barclays, served as lead structuring agents, bookrunners and sales managers in subsequent ABS issues. They were not merely passive funders, but the very designers of financial products sold to global investors.

      "Originate to Distribute" moral hazard
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     This dual role creates a strong incentive to separate it from the balance sheet regardless of the quality of the asset. After providing early warehouse loans, the fastest way for banks to collect funds and secure profits was to securitize and sell the loan. This is a classic moral hazard structure, with the ability to pass risk on downstream investors significantly undermining the incentive for thorough due diligence.
    </p>
    <h4 id="大脱出">
     <strong>
      "Great Escape"
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <p>
     The fact that JPMorgan and Barclays limited trading of Tricolor-related ABS after obtaining "significant unpublished information" but before the entire market collapsed, is conclusive evidence. This suggests that they first exploited their privileged position to protect themselves. This behavior is very similar to the 2008 financial crisis when some banks were selling RMBS to their customers while also betting on its decline in value.

     The allegations against Tricolor's underwriter are surprisingly similar to the recorded actions of Deutsche Bank during the RMBS crisis. A U.S. Department of Justice's investigation of Deutsche Bank found that it intentionally securitized defective mortgages, falsely deceived the quality of underwriting standards, and concealed known risks from investors.

     In the Tricolor case, the "defects" in the collateral were not merely poor underwriting standards, but rather the obvious allegations of double collateral. The underwriting secretaries involved as warehouse lenders were most advantageous in understanding the true status of the collateral. Nevertheless, the formation and sale of these assets meant that they essentially circulated the market financial products that they should have known to be at least very suspicious and, in the worst case, to be fraudulently contaminated. In terms of their direct involvement in both funding and sales, the syndicate, centered around JPMorgan and Barclays, could be said to be "playing Deutsche Bank" in this case. This syndicate structure makes it difficult to identify a single "villain" as in 2008, but also has the effect of obscuring the location of responsibility. It is possible to argue that each row shifted responsibility to each other and relied on the due diligence of other banks. But they

     The immediate response in the broader credit market was limited. The ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option Adjusted Spread (HY OAS) has been at a historic low of around 2.8% as of September 2025, indicating that the market views the Tricolor problem as a fraud case unique to a company, rather than a systemic problem that spreads across the sector.

     However, this market calm is in contrast to the worsening fundamentals. The 60-day or more late rate for subprime car loans is the second highest since 2006. The loss rate for subprime ABS is also on the rise. Other lenders are also showing signs of stress, including Automotive Credit Corp. halting new lending. Peter Cecchini of Axonic Capital has clearly warned that the situation could be a "coal mine canary in the subprime auto loan market" caused by reckless underwriting standards fueled by insatiable demand from ABS investors.

       This sudden and large-scale demand for government bonds clashes with a market that is already struggling to absorb the large amount of new government and corporate bonds issuance.

     The real danger of this scenario is not the direct losses of Tricolor itself. it is,
     <strong>
      Process transmission
     </strong>
     It is. The discovery that the fundamental process of collateral verification has collapsed in major regulated US financial institutions has led investors and regulators to the natural question, "If it happened here, then wouldn't it happen anywhere else?" If this question spreads to other non-bank lenders and other types of ABS, a credit contraction is inevitable. It could lead to a wider credit market freeze that goes beyond the subprime car loan market.

    <p>
     In this scenario, we assume that lead managers, JPMorgan and Barclays, have effectively hedged their exposure using prior information on fraud. This could include shorting the subprime automotive loan ABS index, purchasing credit protection for a particular tranche, or selling your holdings to unsuspecting customers before limiting transactions.

     The direct losses to the lead manager are limited to the initial warehouse loan allowance for doubtful accounts. The ultimate loss will be borne by the subordinated and institutional investors who purchased the mezzanine tranche. The market will treat this case as a limited amount, but the subprime automotive loan ABS sector experiences painful repricing, and new issuances from small, poorly-proven originators will fall into a "buyer-free."

    <p>
     The risk has been effectively passed on, but its final holders are systemically susceptible institutions, such as public pension funds and small regional banks that have been attracted to ESG narratives for their "yield pursuit." The losses aren't enough to shake up major investment banks, but they are large enough to damage the capital of these small players.

     This could lead to a "mini-financial crisis," which could require small banks to bail out or forced mergers. Public pension funds report significant valuation losses, leading to political backlash and demands for investigation into their investment practices. The reputation damage to the ESG investment industry will be serious and long-term.

     Tricolor's collapse serves as the "Bear Stearns Moment" in the subprime consumer credit market. The process spreads rapidly, and investors begin to question not only car loan ABS, but also unsecured consumer loan ABS and other exotic securitized products.

A flight to quality overwhelms the handling capacity of the US Treasury market, forcing Fed intervention (e.g., providing emergency liquidity facilities). All new issuing markets except for the highest quality borrowers will freeze completely. This scenario corresponds to a true systemic event.

    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Complete Resolution of Exposure:
       </strong>
       In particular, all exposure to subprime car loans ABS issued by small non-bank originators will be eliminated.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Scrutiny of assets held:
       </strong>
       A detailed examination of bonds and equity holdings of local banks involved in warehouse lending to non-bank financial institutions.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Performing hedges:
       </strong>
       Purchase short-term protection of high yield credit indexes (e.g. put options for HYG, JNK) as a cheap hedge against the current complementary (complacency) in the market.
      </p>

      Strategic Positioning
     </strong>
    </h4>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Monitoring ABS spreads:
       </strong>
       If spreads begin to expand beyond the subprime auto loan sector, it is an important signal that is increasing the likelihood of scenario 2 or 3.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Dynamics monitoring of "The Night of Valpurgis":
       </strong>
       Pay close attention to the outcomes of US Treasury bids towards the end of the quarter and dealer positioning. If there are indications of market dysfunction, we should move to a broader "risk-off" position.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Identifying opportunities:
       </strong>
       Market overreactions could create a good buy opportunity if the spreads of quality Prime Automotive Loan ABS (e.g. Ford Credit, issued by Toyota Financial) expand in conjunction with the subprime sector. The important thing is to distinguish between fraud among individual companies and deterioration in trust across sectors.
