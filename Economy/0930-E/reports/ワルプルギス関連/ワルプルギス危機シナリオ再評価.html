     Chapter 1 Political Prerequisites for Catastrophe: A "household account book" worldview and financial breach policy
    </h2>
    <h3 id="家計簿誤謬解体">
     Dismantling the fallacies of household account books
    </h3>
    <p>
     Understanding the technical trigger mechanism is not sufficient to assess the probability of a systemic financial crisis known as the narrow sense of Walpurgis. First, we must establish an underlying political and behavioral economic environment that allows such technical failure to happen realistically. At the heart of this environment is the political narrative presented in designated sources, the "household book"-like mode of thinking that equates the national finances with the finances of individual households.
    </p>
    <p>
     This "an analogy between government and household finances" has been pointed out for many years as an economical error. There is a fundamental and qualitative difference between the two. First, unlike household finances, sovereign governments that issue their own currency, do not fall nominally insolvent. Secondly, the government has the ultimate means of securing revenue, the right to collect taxes. Third, the government's planning period is virtually endless, allowing for intergenerational investment and debt management, while the household life cycle is finite. Finally, while government spending plays a macroeconomic role in creating domestic demand for the entire economy and shaping its own tax revenue base, the impact of individual household spending on the entire economy is subtle.
    </p>
    <h3 id="誤謬政策財政的瀬戸際政策常態化">
     From error to policy: A normalization of fiscal brink policy
    </h3>
    <p>
     When this economic fallacy is adopted beyond mere rhetorical metaphor, it transforms into a concrete, market-destabilizing policy. This worldview, which views national debt as a moral failure rather than as a financial instrument that underlies the global financial system, inevitably encourages political conflicts over financial brink policies, particularly debt caps. Such policies apply the household's logic of "lives that suit your strength" to the nation in a way that is fundamentally contradicts the role of the US dollar as the world's core currency. As a result, the perception among domestic and international market participants is fostered as an unreliable debtor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The impact of this political environment on the behavior of market participants is enormous. In particular, it directly affects the actions of foreign investors (such as central banks, government funds) that are essential for the functioning of the US Treasury market. Government policies, which operate on a household accounting model, are significantly undermining trust due to their ad hoc and unpredictable nature. This will lead investors to demand a higher risk premium on US Treasury, encouraging diversification from US dollar assets in the long term. It is this process that gradually but surely meets the technical trigger conditions for failure to bid for government bonds, as detailed in the later section.
    </p>
    <h3 id="政治的兵器化海外需要慢性的侵食">
     Weaponization of political rhetoric and chronic erosion of overseas demand
    </h3>
    <p>
     This analogy of "household accounting books" is not merely a product of economic ignorance. It is a powerful political tool that reduces complex economic problems into a morally simplified narrative that resonates with the financial pressures of their own households facing voters. This rhetoric creates a political incentive structure that relies on financial confrontation rather than stability, increasing the likelihood of policy mistakes that trigger a crisis being made. The metaphor used by politicians to resonate with voters results in inherent uncertainty in the world's most important financial markets, and is a direct source of systemic financial risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     The technical analysis document models the failure of government bond bids as a fire event at a specific time. However, from an integrated perspective in this analysis, this political environment has caused chronic and slow erosion of overseas demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, long before the date of the crisis, September 30, 2025. This means that the financial system is already vulnerable by the time it enters its bid on the day of the crisis, and its buffer to absorb shocks is falling. The firing of a crisis must be understood as a final and acute event that occurs at the end of a long-term degenerative disease rather than a sudden heart attack in a healthy system. As US administrations become perceived as unstable, foreign central banks and government funds begin gradually reducing their allocation to U.S. Treasury as part of risk management. This reduces the baseline of indirect bidding in all government bond biddings. As a result, when a certain shock occurred on September 30th, the market's absorption capacity has been significantly compromised as the major buyers have already been shrinking and becoming more cautious. Therefore, this political environment effectively lowers the threshold that is considered "no bid."

     Chapter 2: Corrosion of institutional firewalls: The Federal Reserve System Under Political Siege
    </h2>
    <p>
     In evaluating the probability that the "narrow Walpurgis" crisis will escalate from a manageable market shock (L1 scenario) to a systemic collapse (L2/L3 scenario), the single variable most important is the systematic and unprecedented political attack on Federal Reserve's independence. This attack fundamentally undermines the reliability and effectiveness of the institutions that should be at the forefront of crisis response.
    </p>
    <h3 id="歴史的前例逸脱">
     Historical precedents and their departures
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Fed's independence has long served as a cornerstone of financial stability in the US and around the world. The inherent tension between the president and the Fed is not historically new. However, the ongoing campaigns differ fundamentally not only in their degree, but in their nature. It is multi-faceted pressure, including open personality attacks on the Fed chairperson, threats to be fired, and attempts to send loyal figures to the board, which are deemed politically motivated.
    </p>
    <h3 id="制度的掌握試理事氏事例">
     An attempt to grasp the system: the case of Director Cook and Mr. Milan
    </h3>
    <p>
     The latest trends as of mid-September 2025 clearly indicate the severity of this institutional corrosion. First, it is an attempt to dismiss Director Lisa Cook on skeptical grounds. Dismissal of Federal Reserve directors is limited by law to "for cause," and this has traditionally been interpreted as meaning neglect of duty or misconduct. This unilateral redefining standard for "justice" is nothing more than a direct attack on legal firewalls that protect the Fed's independence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second, it was the nomination of White House economic advisor Stephen Milan to be the Federal Reserve Board member. The suggestion that Milan could also serve as White House adviser and Federal Reserve Director disrupted the long-standing norm of separation of executive branches and central banks. This risks the Fed effectively transformed into an institution that carries out the executive political agenda.
    </p>
    <h3 id="政治化経済的帰結">
     The economic consequences of politicization
    </h3>
    <p>
     The economic costs of politically subordinated central banks are both historically and theoretical. It is higher, more unstable inflation, increased economic instability, and ultimately monetization of the fiscal deficit (direct underwriting of government bonds by the central bank). The Fed, recognized by the market as acting on political directives, loses the credibility essential to stabilizing (anchoring) inflation expectations. This reliability is the most powerful policy tool that a central bank has.
    </p>
    <h3 id="消防士放火犯崩壊">
     The paradox of "fire fighters are arsonists" and the collapse of the forward guidance
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Fed is a major institution that plays a role in containing the financial crisis using tools such as discount counters, quantitative easing (QE), and dollar swap lines. A successful political campaign to undermine the Fed's legitimacy creates an extremely dangerous paradox. That is, the very institution that needs to act decisively to put out the fire is being accused by political leadership of being the source of the problem. This will cause fatal hesitation during the crucial time of the first few hours after the crisis. It is likely that political leadership, which has been attacking the Fed for months when a crisis hits the Fed when it comes to supply trillions of dollars of liquidity to the market, will denounce the essential action as "wall street relief" and "deep state conspiracy." The Fed may take action as too slow or too small under extreme political pressure to keep its organization alive. This hesitancy transforms liquidity tightness into a crisis of payment, dramatically amplifying the damages. Political attacks thus become a self-fulfilling prophecy of institutional failure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, the power of central banks is heavily dependent on their ability to shape market expectations through reliable communication ("forward guidance"). This communication channel will be destroyed if markets come to believe that the Fed's decisions are influenced by political whims rather than economic data. Market participants are no longer able to effectively price risks as the central bank's "reaction function" becomes unclear and unpredictable. This significant increase in uncertainty has a kind of monetary tightening effect in itself, and is a direct cause of market vulnerability. Even if the Fed says that policies are "depending on data," if the president openly demands interest rate cuts regardless of data, the market will have to incorporate two possibilities (either following the data or succumbing to the president) into prices. This ambiguity will increase the volatility of interest rate futures and options, forcing financial institutions to reduce leverage and curb risk taking. In this way, political intervention functions as a "shadow monetary policy" that purely destabilizes the market even before the Fed makes any decisions.

     Chapter 3: Anatomy of financial triggers: September 30th Re-examination of failure of government bond bids
    </h2>
    <p>
     The fire event in the "narrow sense Walpurgis" is a technical failure to fulfill the US Treasury bid to be held on September 30, 2025. This section rigorously analyzes quantitative trigger thresholds for non-bidging, and clarify how the political and behavioral economic factors discussed in the previous chapter directly contribute to the deterioration of these indicators.
    </p>
    <h3 id="入札不成立四騎士">
     Four Knights who have not yet made bids
    </h3>
    <p>
     The technical analysis document defines the "fire" of a crisis as the simultaneous breaking of a threshold of at least two of the following four important auction indicators: These thresholds are adjusted based on data from past market stress periods, and provide a clear distinction between mere "slow" bids and systemic failures.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tail ≥ 8–12bp
       </strong>
       : This shows that the difference between the highest winning bid yield at an auction and the expected yield on the When-Issued market just before bidding reaches an unusual level. The standard tail is 1-2 basis points (bp), while the 8-12bp level means that primary demand at the expected price has completely collapsed.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Bid-to-Cover Ratio ≤ 2.00
       </strong>
       : This ratio, which divides the total bid amount by the offering amount, shows the strength of demand. As healthy bids usually go well above 2.0, levels below 2.0 suggest a catastrophic lack of demand from the end customers.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Indirect bidder share ≤ 50%
       </strong>
       : The share of indirect bidders, including foreign central banks, is a key barometer of global demand. If the market share is normally 60-65% below 50%, it will be a clear signal of capital flight from overseas, namely "capital strike."
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Primary Dealer (PD) allocation ≥ 40%
       </strong>
       : Shows that the ultimate buyer, the primary dealer, has been forced to absorb an unusually large share. The normal allocation is around 10-15%, while the 40% level means that the dealer community is forced to take on an indigesible amount of duration risk.

     The trigger is a sign of illness, not the disease itself
    </h3>
    <p>
     The technical analysis document treats failure to bid as a "fire" event. However, our integrated view shows that the failure to bids is the first time that a more serious, deep-rooted, existing medical condition can be observed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Signs
     </strong>
     It's just. The condition is a fundamental loss of confidence in the American political and economic system. The market does not collapse for technical reasons, but because political actors have broken the implicit rules that underpin U.S. Treasury bond status as a "risk-free" asset.
    </p>
    <p>
     The "risk-free" nature of US Treasury is not simply about having the ability to repay. it is,
     <strong>
      There is no doubt that the will to pay it back
     </strong>
     and support those decisions
     <strong>
      The institutional framework is predictable
     </strong>
     It depends on. The political actions mentioned in Chapters 1 and 2 directly attack this predictability and will itself. After seeing this, foreign investors begin treating U.S. Treasury bonds not as risk-free assets, but as credit assets with political risk. And the moment when this slow, under-surface reassessment suddenly surfaces as an open and undeniable market event is a failed government bond bid.
    </p>
    <h3 id="非対称情報問題">
     Asymmetric information problem
    </h3>
    <p>
     Extreme information asymmetry is expected to occur a few hours before a bid is made. Washington policymakers and insiders at major dealer banks will be far more clearly aware of the imminent disaster than general market participants. This information asymmetry induces advance position adjustments and hedging transactions in the futures market. If dealers sell futures in anticipation of coming losses, this could in itself create a gap between the physical market and the futures market (the collapse of the "basis" mentioned in the technical documents), worsening the failure to bid.
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, let's say some major overseas central banks informally not having to participate in their next bid. This information will be leaked to primary dealers who are required to bid. Dealers expect to be holding unpopular inventory and begin aggressively selling government bond futures to hedge risks ahead of time. This will cause futures prices to fall, and a signal to signal the market as a whole is approaching crisis. Other investors who have no information received this signal also withdraw from the bid, and the failure to bid becomes a real self-fulfilling prophecy.

    <h2 id="第4章-増幅危機後規制伝染媒介">
     Chapter 4: Cascade of Amplification: How post-crisis regulations can mediate contagion
    </h2>
    <p>
     How will a limited failure to bid be amplified into a systemic crisis? The mechanism is embedded within the very regulatory framework introduced after the 2008 financial crisis. This section details these amplification mechanisms and discusses how political paralysis prevents the activation of known circuit breakers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="1slr名拘束衣">
     Mechanism 1: A strait jacket called SLR
    </h3>
    <p>
     The first amplifier is the complementary leverage ratio (SLR). The regulations were introduced as a simple leverage cap that is not dependent on bank risk weighting, in reflection on the 2008 crisis. However, when primary dealers are forced to absorb government bonds of more than 40% of their bids, their leverage indicators violate the regulatory cap. The result would force dealers to sell more assets in a declining market to reduce their balance sheet, rather than absorbing the shock. In this way, regulations aimed at the soundness of individual banks take away the overall system's function as shock absorbers and transform dealers into shock amplifiers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="2ccp流動性">
     Mechanism 2: CCP's fluidity death spiral
    </h3>
    <p>
     The second and more powerful amplifier is a procyclical feedback loop through the central clearing agency (CCP). The sharp decline in government bond prices and sudden volatility lead to large-scale, simultaneous margin calls from major CCPs such as CMEs (futures) and FICC (physical and reporting). This margin model is designed essentially procyclical (business cycle amplification). That is, the more volatility in the market, the more margin the clearing agency will require to protect itself. This mechanism has the fatal side effect of sucking up liquidity from the system at the very moment when liquidity is at its most tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     To secure cash to pay margin, market participants are forced to sell their most liquid assets: US Treasury. This throw-off seller further pushes down government bond prices and increases volatility, which induces further margin demand. This self-enhancing feedback is the true nature of the "liquidity death spiral" and the engine of the market collapse.

     Political veto on solutions
    </h3>
    <p>
     Importantly, regulators (particularly the Fed) are aware of the dangers of these procyclical dynamics. During past market stress (for example, March 2020), the Fed has a track record of reducing system tensions by taking measures such as a temporary exemption from the SLR. However, in an extremely politicized environment as discussed in Chapter 2, it becomes extremely difficult to implement similar measures. Crisis response measures such as the exemption from the SLR and massive quantitative easing will be immediately labelled as "wall street relief" and will be the subject of political attacks. The perceived political costs of action are too high, leading regulators to sit and watch as the cascade of amplification falls out of control.
    </p>
    <h3 id="健全性規制兵器化">
     Micro-Personality Regulation Paradox and the Weaponization of the Global Dollar
    </h3>
    <p>
     This crisis exposes the fundamental design flaws inherent in regulatory architecture in 2008. The margin models for SLR and CCP were designed to make individual financial institutions safer (microgenicity). However, in a systemic crisis, these rules are exactly the paradox that makes the entire system more vulnerable (failure of macro-genicity). This regulatory framework implicitly assumes the existence of a reasonable, non-political crisis manager who can suspend the rules when they become destabilizing factors. This analysis shows that this premise is no longer valid. SLRs introduced to prevent excessive leverage of individual banks legally prevent the most stamina from using their balance sheets to support the market in the event of a systemic shock. And the political environment will block emergency exemptions by regulators. Thus, rules designed to prevent a recurrence in 2008 are one of the main causes of the collapse in 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, this amplification mechanism transcends borders. As detailed in the Technical Analysis Document, the crisis causes a serious global US dollar shortage, leading to forced sales of US assets by overseas financial institutions. A third consequence in this context is that in a new political environment, access to the Fed's dollar swapline is no longer a purely technical decision. It could be given or withheld on the basis of political partnerships, effectively weaponizing the global financial safety net. When the crisis sparks a global battle for the dollar, foreign central banks call on the Fed for emergency liquidity. The US administration may view this as an opportunity to exercise political influence and may implicitly (or blatantly) link access to swaplines to its support for US foreign policy. If access to countries deemed unfriendly is delayed or restricted, they will be forced into more destructive assets fire sales, further increasing the economic crisis. In this way, tools for containment of the crisis will be transformed into tools for geopolitical use of power, further shattering global cooperation and trust.

     Chapter 5: Global shockwaves: An overview of countries' vulnerabilities and financial failures
    </h2>
    <p>
     Although the "narrow sense of Walpurgis" is the epicenter of the United States, the shock waves instantly spread all over the world, destroying each country's financial systems in line with its inherent vulnerabilities. This section provides an overview of the inherent risks faced by major countries and regions, and the estimated financial losses by scenario, based on the technical analysis report Walpurgis Crisis: An International Financial Market Impact Assessment. Losses occur through four major channels: direct losses in US Treasury, losses from currency fluctuations, losses in the banking sector, and a crash in the stock market.

     Vulnerability analysis by major countries and regions
    </h3>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Japan:
       </strong>
       Japan's vulnerability is summed up in the fact that it is the world's largest US bond holder. The holdings of approximately $1.1 trillion means that the price of US Treasury will create a direct and immediate solvency crisis on the balance sheets of the Bank of Japan, the Pension Reserve Fund Management and Management Independent Administrative Institution (GPIF), and major commercial banks. Furthermore, it is expected that the yen will be bought as a "safe asset" in the event of a crisis and will skyrocket. This sudden appreciation of the yen will be a devastating blow to Japan's export-driven economy, and at the same time, it will significantly reduce the yen's conversion value of Japan's huge foreign net assets, which amounts to approximately $3.5 trillion.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        U.K:
       </strong>
       The UK's biggest Achilles heel is the City of London banking sector, deeply integrated with the global US dollar market. The UK-based major banks have huge US dollar-denominated balance sheets and rely heavily on the short-term wholesale market for funding. The outbreak of a crisis will completely freeze this market and cause a serious liquidity crisis. The approximately $723 billion U.S. Treasury held by the UK is not merely sovereign risk, but rather the collateral value of the banking system, and its crash directly triggers the transmission of the banking crisis. Its role as a global US dollar hub, which was a strength in peacetime, has been transformed into catastrophic vulnerability during the crisis, and the UK will become the epicenter of the crisis outside the US.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        China:
       </strong>
       China has officially held US Treasury bonds of approximately $759 billion in official reserves, and the price crash will result in severe losses on the People's Bank of China's balance sheet. However, a more severe systemic risk is that this crisis could lead to uncontrolled capital outflows. Chinese authorities face a trilemma of tolerating a sharp drop in the yuan, which leads to capital flight, spending valuable foreign currency reserves to defend the exchange rate, or imposing stricter capital regulations. This crisis could be a challenge to the regime, threatening the Chinese Communist Party's control over financial stability.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hongkong:
       </strong>
       For Hong Kong, this crisis is a survival crisis against the US dollar currency peg system itself. The backing assets held by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to support the peg system are primarily US dollar denominated assets. The default on US Treasury overturns the definition of "risk-free" assets, plunges the value of the underlying assets, and fundamentally shakes the credibility of the overall peg system. If HKMA raises local interest rates to astronomical levels to defend Pegg, the Hong Kong economy and banking system will collapse. In the L3 (systemic collapse) scenario, this peg is assumed to be unsustainable and collapsed, which would be a catastrophic moment of value destruction for all Hong Kong dollar assets.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        European Union (Germany and France):
       </strong>
       Like the UK, the EU's major vulnerability lies in its reliance on US dollar funding in the globally active major banking sector. Banks in particular in France and Germany are deeply dependent on US Money Market Funds (MMFs), the leading source of short-term US dollar funds. The crisis has led to a massive withdrawal of funds from MMF, directly leading to a liquidity crisis that is reminiscent of 2008, but potentially more severe.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The following table summarizes the major vulnerability channels of each country and estimated financial losses by scenario based on technical analysis documents. This table transforms abstract trillion dollar losses into concrete strategic risk maps. This allows decision makers to understand at a glance how much a country suffers, as well as why it suffers.

     Note: The amount of loss is based on the estimates stated in the document.
    </p>
    <p>
     This analysis shows that the pathways of crisis transmission vary widely from country to country. For example, Japan's early hit was a loss on the balance sheet, whereas the UK's malfunction is a financing market. This difference suggests that different indicators need to be focused on in monitoring the crisis and building hedging strategies.

     Chapter 6: Reassessment of probability of occurrence by scenario: Integrating technical vulnerabilities and political risks
    </h2>
    <p>
     The analytical core of this report is to combine previous discussions and reevaluate the probability of occurrence by scenario in the narrow sense of Walpurgis. This reassessment is done by setting baseline probabilities based purely on a technical model and applying the effects of the corrosive political environment detailed in this report as a "political stress multiplier."
    </p>
    <h3 id="確率技術的要因">
     Baseline probability (technical factors only)
    </h3>
    <p>
     First, we establish a baseline probability distribution under the assumption that the political environment is "normal" or "rational." In this ideal world, failure to hold a government bond bid is a technical accident with low probability, and crisis response agencies are assumed to act quickly and effectively. Under these conditions, the probability of crisis occurrence and escalation can be assessed as extremely low.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        L1 (serious) baseline probability:
       </strong>
       5%
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        L2 (catastrophic) baseline probability:
       </strong>
       1%
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        L3 (systemic collapse) baseline probability:
       </strong>
       0.1%
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="政治的乗数psm">
     Political Stress Multiplier (PSM)
    </h3>
    <p>
     Next, we introduce the conceptual multiplier, "Political Stress Multiplier (PSM)," derived from the qualitative analyses of Chapters 1 and 2. PSM is a function of two main variables: (1) the degree of unpredictability of fiscal policy, and (2) the degree of erosion of central bank independence. Based on the analysis of this report, this multiplier under current circumstances is well above 1.
    </p>
    <p>
     Importantly, this multiplier has a nonlinear effect on each scenario. PSM increases the probability of an initial trigger event (L1) to some extent, but its true power means that the crisis escalates from L1 to L2 to L3.
     <strong>
      Conditional Probability
     </strong>
     It is in the point that dramatically increases the number. This is because the political factors identified in this report work primarily by numbing the mechanisms of crisis containment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="再評価確率">
     Probability of being reevaluated
    </h3>
    <p>
     Applying PSM to baseline probability derives a more realistic probability assessment that incorporates political reality.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        L1 (serious) reassessment probability:
       </strong>
       From 5% of baseline
       <strong>
        15%
       </strong>
       rises to. This is because the financial management of a "household account book" and the decline in confidence in the United States make the trigger event itself significantly more likely to occur, such as a failure to bid.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        L2 (catastrophic) reassessment probability:
       </strong>
       From 1% of baseline
       <strong>
        10%
       </strong>
       It skyrockets to. This dramatic rise reflects a significant increase in the probability of escalation from L1 to L2. This is because the politically paralyzed Fed is likely to be reluctant to deploy overwhelming countermeasures such as exemption from the SLR and large-scale quantitative easing, leaving the SLR and CCP amplification cascade detailed in Chapter 4 left unchecked.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        L3 (systemic collapse) reassessment probability:
       </strong>
       From 0.1% of baseline
       <strong>
        5%
       </strong>
       The relatively large rise. The final escalation from L2 to L3 is amplified by the collapse of international cooperation. The weaponization of the dollar swap line and the overall loss of trust in the US as a global financial steward make it impossible for the coordinated G7 to respond, making the worst-case scenario a reality.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The following table is the final product of this reassessment process and summarizes the quantitative conclusions that the analysis of this report brings. By presenting the "baseline" and "reevaluation" probability side by side, we clearly and quantitatively show the impact of political analysis.
    </p>

     Note: Loss amounts are based on the document and scenario definitions are based on the document. Probability is the evaluation value based on an integrated analysis of this report.
    </p>
    <p>
     This assessment clearly shows that in modern financial risk analysis, a technical model alone is not sufficient. The most vulnerable point of a system is no longer in financial engineering calculations, but in the very dysfunction of the political system that is supposed to manage that system.

    </h2>
    <p>
     The analysis results of this report provide senior-level decision makers with a set of actionable intelligence on portfolio strategy, risk monitoring and long-term strategic positioning. In conclusion, erosion of institutional reliability within the United States is the most important macrotrend of our time, with serious and lasting effects on all asset classes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="前調整">
     Pre-event portfolio adjustments
    </h3>
    <p>
     The analysed scenarios, particularly the increased probability of their occurrence, justifies the transition from passive risk management to an aggressive defensive position.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Reduced duration:
       </strong>
       Given that the core of the crisis is the violent reassessment of duration risk due to the term premium shock, aggressively shortening the duration of the entire portfolio is the most direct and effective defence. This directly reduces price sensitivity to interest rate increases.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Enhanced fluidity:
       </strong>
       Based on the analysis that CCP's cascade of margin requests causes a "liquidity death spiral," it is essential to increase the ratio of cash and cash equivalents. This will ensure that "dry powder (waiting funds)" is used to avoid forced asset sales during times of crisis and to capture investment opportunities after the crisis.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Building tail risk hedges:
       </strong>
       Build hedges targeting dynamics unique to this crisis. This includes long positions in gold (gold) as traditional safe assets, long positions in the safe asset currency of the country (yen, Swiss franc) with strong external net assets, and potential short positions for the most vulnerable nodes (e.g. Hong Kong dollars, UK banking sector stocks).

     High Frequency Monitoring Dashboard
    </h3>
    <p>
     The "Real-Time Crisis Monitoring Dashboard" in the technical analysis document will be used as an operational early warning system. For the weeks leading up to September 30th, 2025, we will need to be particularly keen on the following key leading indicators:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        When-Issued spreads and auction indicators (such as bid rate):

       The most important indicator that directly shows the market expectations and actual demand for bids.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        SOFR Interest Rates and Fail to Deliver:
       </strong>
       An indicator of stress in the funding market (repo market) and dysfunction in the payment system.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Cross Currency Base Swap:
       </strong>
       The most sensitive indicator of the severity of the global US dollar shortage.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        SRF/FIMA Facility Usage:
       </strong>
       The increasing dependence on the Fed's liquidity supply facility is a clear indication that the private market is becoming dysfunctional.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="戦略的展望後世界">
     Strategic Perspective: The Post-Walpurgis World
    </h3>
    <p>
     If a "narrow sense of Walpurgis" occurs, it will not simply be a cyclical recession, but a structural disconnect. It marks the critical end of the post-World War II financial order centered around the status of US sovereign bonds as "risk-free" assets.
    </p>
    <p>
     The long-term outcome is predicted to be the arrival of the world as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The rise of the multipolar currency system:
       </strong>
       The unipolar domination of the US dollar ends, and the euro, renminbi, or supranational digital currencies will move towards a multipolar reserve currency system in which the euro, renminbi, or supranational digital currencies play a bigger role.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Exploring alternative reserve assets:
       </strong>
       Gold and other commodities, as well as certain crypto assets, will be revalued as national-level reserve assets.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The fundamental repricing of sovereign risk:
       </strong>
       The very concept of "risk-free interest rates" has collapsed, and sovereign debt in all countries is subject to a more rigorous credit analysis based on the political stability and institutional reliability of the country.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The ultimate strategic implication of this report is the recognition that political risks, particularly the institutional health of democracies, have now become a central analytical target in risk assessments of financial markets, are no longer exogenous "tail risks." This adaptation to this new paradigm will be the key factor in securing success and failure in asset management over the next few decades.
