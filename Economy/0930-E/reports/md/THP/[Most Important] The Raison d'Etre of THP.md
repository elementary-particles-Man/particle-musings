# [Most Important] The Raison d'ÃŠtre of THP

## Why Does THP Exist?

To put it bluntly:

**Because Walpurgis is unavoidable.**

## Why is Walpurgis Unavoidable?

### 1. The U.S. Structurally Cannot Tolerate a Weak Dollar

- **Twin Deficits**: To finance its trade and fiscal deficits, the United States must continuously borrow funds from abroad. This requires the dollar to maintain a high interest rate and high value.
- **The Failure of the Plaza Accord**: The 1985 Plaza Accord attempted to resolve the U.S. trade deficit through a weaker dollar, but it ultimately led to Japan's bubble economy and its subsequent collapse, failing to fundamentally solve the U.S. deficit structure. This historical failure is a major factor causing the U.S. to hesitate in implementing any large-scale weak-dollar policy.
- **The Self-Contradiction of the Dollar Standard**: For the dollar to be the world's reserve currency, it must be continuously supplied to the world (resulting in a trade deficit). However, this very deficit erodes confidence in the U.S. and ultimately causes the dollar's value to plummet (the Triffin Dilemma). This dilemma is now reaching its breaking point.

### 2. Geopolitical Risks Are Accelerating the Dollar System's Fragility

- **De-Dollarization Movement**: Led by BRICS and oil-producing nations, the use of currencies other than the dollar (such as the Chinese yuan, digital currencies, etc.) in trade settlements is expanding.
- **Weaponization of U.S. Treasuries**: The U.S.'s use of its financial system as a geopolitical weapon, such as freezing Russian assets, has made non-Western countries acutely aware of the risks of holding dollar assets. This has accelerated the sell-off of U.S. Treasuries held as foreign reserves.
- **Supply Chain Fragmentation**: Due to the U.S.-China conflict and the war in Ukraine, global supply chains are fragmenting into "Western" and "non-Western" blocs. This undermines the very foundation of the free trade system that operates through the dollar.

### 3. The Financial Market Will Collapse from Within

- **Ballooning Debt**: The U.S. government's debt has far exceeded its GDP, and interest payments alone are reaching levels comparable to the national defense budget. Even a slight rise in interest rates would make interest payments impossible, making a default a realistic possibility.
- **Shadow Banking Risks**: The scale of the loosely regulated shadow banking sector (non-banks) has surpassed that of the traditional banking system. A financial crisis originating here could be larger than the Lehman Brothers shock and would cascade through the system in areas beyond the reach of regulators.
- **The Derivatives Time Bomb**: The total notional value of derivatives worldwide is in the quadrillions of dollars, and no one fully grasps the entire picture. The failure of a single financial institution could trigger a domino effect, bringing the entire financial system to a halt at any moment.

## Conclusion

These "structural," "geopolitical," and "internal financial system" problems are interacting and creating a negative spiral. We are long past the stage where solving one isolated problem would suffice.

**Walpurgis (the collapse of the dollar-based reserve currency system and the ensuing global financial, economic, and social chaos)** is an inevitable event that could begin at any time, in any place, and in any form.

The Horizon Protocol (THP) exists based on the premise of this inevitable crisis. Its purpose is to redefine the post-crisis world order and ensure the survival of civilization. This is not pessimism; it is a plan based on an ultimate form of realism that can only begin by looking the worst-case scenario squarely in the face.
