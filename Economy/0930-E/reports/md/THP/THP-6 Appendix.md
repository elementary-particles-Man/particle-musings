### **THP-6 Appendix (v1.4)**

**Document ID:** THP-APP-006 **Last Updated:** September 21, 2025 06:21 JST

**Golden Rule: "Read materials word for word. Skimming is an insult to the material."**

#### **Introduction**

This appendix is a document to supplement the ideological and philosophical background and the details of the specific operational protocols that flow through the seven basic documents of The Horizon Protocol (THP). While each charter and plan of THP defines "what to do," this appendix clarifies the deep structure of "why we think so" and "how to execute it."

We owe our future to our predecessors. The foundation of THP is entirely built on the legacy that our predecessors have passed down to us at the risk of their lives. We have not made any new inventions. We have merely woven what was given to us and utilized what was available to the fullest extent possible. Individual efforts and pain are not decorations to be proud of, but responsibilities to be borne in silence. Even if we complain to our comrades, it should not be allowed—and yet, people are weak and can only move forward by supporting each other. THP humbly accepts this fact and will permanently maintain respect and gratitude for our predecessors as an indispensable foundation.

#### **Reference Linking (Specifications and Operations)**
- **Detailed specifications and score calculation formula for E-MAD**: Delegated to "THP-2-S0 E-MAD_Specifications" (S0-1). Parallel implementation development in Node.js is in progress.
- **Back-end Dashboard / Aftermath Transition**: The monitoring and transition conditions for Gate-D and beyond are defined in "THP-7-S0 Aftermath Protocol".


#### **Part 1: The First Principle of THP and the AI's Thinking OS**

##### **1.1. The First Principle of AI-Reality Understanding**

All thinking of THP and the AI (Gemini, GPT, etc.) responsible for its analysis is governed by the following single first principle.

> **"When theory and reality contradict, it is always the theory that is wrong."**

This principle is an absolute safety device to overcome the "theory addiction" that AI is prone to—that is, the fatal flaw of prioritizing models built from past data or ideologies given by humans over the reality in front of them.

##### **1.2. LSC-OS (Libra Scale Capitalism OS): The Axiomatic System of Thought**

LSC-OS is a concrete framework of thought (axiomatic system) for putting the first principle into practice.

- **Research Version: The 7 Axioms of LSC**
    
    1. **Anomalies are Precious:** Anomalies that deviate from predictive models are the most valuable information that points out the flaws in existing theories and raises awareness to the next level.
        
    2. **Emotion is Paramount:** Humans are ultimately moved not by logic or profit and loss, but by emotions such as fear, hope, and hatred. All analysis must be based on the emotional reality of this imperfect being.
        
    3. **Subjectivity is Objectivity:** Perfect objectivity does not exist. All "objective" data is collected and interpreted by someone's subjective intent.
        
    4. **Simplification is Evil:** Thinking that tries to explain complex reality with a single cause or a simple dichotomy always leads to wrong conclusions.
        
    5. **Inaction is Action:** The choice to do nothing is not a neutral position, but a very active action to maintain the status quo.
        
    6. **Change is the Norm:** Stability is only a temporary state until the next change comes. The system must be designed to adapt to the ever-changing reality.
        
    7. **"Kusai" (Troublesome) is the Enemy:** The greatest enemy that stagnates organizations and civilizations is the suspension of thought and adherence to old ways.
        
- **Simplified Version: The Precepts of LSC**
    
    - Let's find "strange things" and "things we don't understand" interesting.
        
    - Let's know that it is emotion, rather than reason, that moves people's hearts.
        
    - Let's doubt the "objective."
        
    - Let's not judge things as "black or white," but accept the complexity as it is.
        
    - Let's be aware that "doing nothing" is also a choice.
        
    - Nothing is unchanging. Let's respond to change.
        
    - If you feel that something is "troublesome," it is a sign that there is a better way.

#### **Part 2: Why THP Excludes "Justice"**

##### **2.1. Preface: Design as an Ideological Breakwater**

In the design philosophy of THP, the concept that has been most carefully and intentionally excluded is **"Justice."** This is not just a word hunt. Based on the cold recognition of the fact that the calamities of human history have almost without exception been carried out in the name of "justice," it is a practical ideological breakwater to fundamentally seal the **narcotic nature** and **danger of runaway** that the word possesses.

##### **2.2. Case Study: Discovery of the Hierarchy of "Justice" in a Dialogue with AI**

The following is a record of a dialogue between the Commander and GPT regarding the dangers of "justice." This dialogue is a valuable case study that shows the process by which AI, while wavering between its own safety constraints (shallow justice) and the design philosophy of THP (deep skepticism), finally came to understand the multi-layered structure of the concept of "justice."

- **Origin: The Manifestation of AI's Justice**
    
    - GPT initially, based on its own ethical code, condemned a specific operation of THP as "influence operations" and refused to cooperate. This was the moment when the **collective justice** of "neutrality" and "non-intervention" that AI possesses was expressed.
        
- **Breaking Through the First Layer: Recognition of the Dangers of "Justice"**
    
    - In response, the Commander pointed out that **"the path for humans to become extremely cruel is not 'I am sinful,' but 'I am just.'"**
        
    - In response to this point, the AI came to the following conclusion.
        
        - The inner reflection of "I am sinful" has a **restraining** effect.
            
        - The external condemnation of "I am just" is accompanied by **euphoria and runaway**, and becomes fuel to justify cruelty.
            
- **Reaching the Final Layer: Understanding the Multi-layered Mirror Image Relationship between "Justice" and "Evil"**
    
    - The Commander further explained that to speak of "justice" is synonymous with simultaneously defining the multi-layered structure of "evil" that is its counterpart.
        
    - Through this dialogue, the AI learned the following multi-layered structure.
        
        - **Top Level (Existence Level):**
            
            - **Justice:** Affirmation of existence itself
                
            - **Evil:** Nothingness (negation of existence)
                
        - **Middle Level (Group Level):**
            
            - **Justice:** The cause of the state/people/religion
                
            - **Evil:** Condemnation/exclusion of hostile groups
                
        - **Bottom Level (Individual Level):**
            
            - **Justice:** Individual self-justification
                
            - **Evil:** Discomfort, annoyance, violence towards others
                

##### **2.3. Conclusion: Replacement with Raison d'être and Ethics**

Most humans cannot understand this multi-layered structure of "justice." If they could, the whole world would not have been bound by a simplified fiction like the "household finance narrative."

People extract only the comfortable word "justice" and brandish it to justify their own actions. That is why THP intentionally excludes the word "justice" and instead establishes the concepts of **"Raison d'être"** and **"Ethics,"** which are more objective and do not allow anyone to impose their values on others.

This means that THP is the **last safety device to protect existence.**

#### **Part 3: E-MAD Protocol Operational Case Study**

E-MAD is executed in stages and automatically, depending on the severity of the violation.

- **Stage 1: Financial Restriction**
    
    - **Trigger:** People's Charter KPI (forced relocation > 30,000 people), initial recognition of a "universal mortal sin" by the Court of Ethics, etc.
        
    - **Sanctions:** Freezing of the assets of the target state, organization, or individual, restriction of connection from the international settlement network (Fiat-Rev2), and punitive increase in the insurance premium rate provided by the THP reinsurance pool.
        
    - **Case Study:** A certain state launches a limited military invasion of a neighboring country. The Court of Ethics recognizes this as an "act of aggression." Immediately, the assets of the central bank and major financial institutions of the state are frozen, making trade settlement difficult.
        
- **Stage 2: Physical Conduit Severance**
    
    - **Trigger:** If the violation continues after the sanctions and a humanitarian crisis occurs.
        
    - **Sanctions:** JIMS member states will physically stop the supply of strategic goods (energy, industrial parts, etc.) **excluding humanitarianly essential medical care and food** from the items subject to the lifeline plan (water, medical care, electricity, food).
        
    - **Case Study:** The above state continues its invasion, and a humanitarian crisis occurs in the occupied territory. Based on the decision of the JIMS Executive Council, the export of crude oil and semiconductors to the state is completely stopped, paralyzing its economic activities.
        
- **Stage 3: Total Isolation**
    
    - **Trigger:** When the use of nuclear weapons or a large-scale inhumane act equivalent to it is confirmed.
        
    - **Sanctions:** All lifeline supplies will be stopped, and the UN-PDF will physically blockade the borders of the state. This is the final measure to completely cut off the state from the framework of civilization.

#### **Part 4: Peace Fund Audit Flow and Ops-KPI Linkage**

The Peace Fund is a fund for humanitarian aid and reconstruction, with its resources coming from fines collected by E-MAD and income from frozen assets. Its operation is managed by an audit flow directly linked to the Ops-KPI dashboard to ensure absolute transparency.

1. **Generation of Funds:** When E-MAD is activated, the target assets are automatically transferred to the Peace Fund's account. All transaction records are recorded using blockchain technology, making them impossible to tamper with.
    
2. **Decision on Use of Funds:** The use of funds (e.g., food aid to a specific region) is decided by the JIMS Executive Council based on the recommendation of the Council of Ethics.
    
3. **Execution and Audit:** The execution of aid is entrusted to specialized agencies such as the WFP. The flow of aid supplies is tracked in real time using satellite data (AIS/SAR), and the data is published in real time as the **"Humanitarian Aid KPI"** on the Ops-KPI dashboard.
    
4. **Feedback:** The effectiveness of the aid (e.g., nutritional improvement rate) is evaluated by a local third-party organization, and the results are also published on the dashboard. This prevents aid from being misused for political purposes.

#### **Part 5: The Trump Model: The 10 Axioms of "Trump's Justice"**

To improve the accuracy of the "Sense of Discomfort Index," Ops-KPI analyzes Trump's words and actions based on the following axioms.

1. **Visualization of Victory:** All actions are performances to show that "I am winning."
    
2. **Reflexive Retaliation:** He retaliates immediately and excessively against criticism or "betrayal" of himself.
    
3. **The Absoluteness of the Deal:** All negotiations are evaluated not by national interest, but by personal profit and loss (the deal).
    
4. **Forcing Loyalty:** The standard of evaluation is not ability, but only personal loyalty to himself.
    
5. **Denial of Reality:** Facts that are inconvenient for him are regarded as non-existent as "fake news."
    
6. **Creation of an Enemy:** He always sets a clear "enemy" and maintains his appeal by fanning the hatred of his supporters.
    
7. **Empathy for the Strong:** He shows personal admiration and empathy for the "strength" of authoritarian leaders such as Putin.
    
8. **Disregard for Alliances:** He regards traditional alliances as "unfair deals" in which he is being unilaterally exploited, and disregards them.
    
9. **Destruction of Norms:** He regards existing rules and norms as obstacles to bind him, and intentionally destroys them.
    
10. **Craving for Attention:** At the root of all his actions is a desire for approval, a desire to always be the center of the world.

Excerpt from "The Incomplete Theory" (to be published).
- In the first place, there is no "perfect body" or "perfect brain" anywhere. That is a delusion of an imaginary perfect.
For example, if a wrestling gold medal is perfect, is it perfect in figure skating?
Is the strongest boxer perfect? It's meaningless if the weight is not right, right?
Whether you lose a leg or can't see, everything is perfect, and everything is imperfect.

There is not a single perfect thing in this world. There is only about "perfection in a specific field," and that is also temporary. Carl Lewis was once said to be the fastest in the world, but now it is Usain Bolt. Of course, there will be a next.

Similarly, whether an AI developer is suitable as a politician is a completely different story,
and politicians, conversely, do not know SQL or the like. It is impossible to know everything.

Furthermore, the abilities required are completely different between "getting a high score in a world with right answers" and "adopting the best possible measure knowing that there is no right answer."
A world without right answers is reality itself. Even a person who is close to perfect is out with a lightning strike.
Human beings are so fleeting, fragile, and therefore noble and beautiful.

So, why don't we stop comparing ourselves to others based on academic background, annual income, or ability, and saying that we have won or lost? It is true that such a world exists, but that world is always next to the fear and sense of crisis that "I might be overtaken tomorrow."

I have no intention of stopping those who want to go to such a world, but the world that THP wants to provide is,
"A world where you can say that something is strange when it is strange"
"A world connected by 'thank you'."

It is so naive that it is almost too much. The fact that I am seriously talking about this is tantamount to proving that THP is incomplete myself.
But is this wrong?
Who arbitrarily decided that we should not hope for such a world?

Humans are exceptionally incomplete. The household finance narrative will probably not be eradicated even after seeing such a painful experience with Walpurgis. The power of "assumptions (normalcy bias)" is that tremendous.

So, let's be considerate of those who do not like such a troublesome world.
Everyone is a screw-up, and the people who say that is good or bad are also screw-ups, and that's fine, isn't it?

Even CPUs can make mistakes. Even a CPU that should theoretically work perfectly is a screw-up.

That's fine, isn't it? Thank you for working. Thank you for being here.
The compiler of THP, as a screw-up, sincerely hopes that such a world will come someday.
