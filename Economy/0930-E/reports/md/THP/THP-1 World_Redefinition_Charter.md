### World Redefinition Charter

### **Preface: Death Certificate for the Old World**

The "national narratives" and "ethnic myths" forged in the 20th century have begun to self-destruct under the weight of their own internal contradictions and historical deceptions. Japan's "international contribution," the UK's "unfading glory," Italy's "historical reconciliation," Israel's "promised land"—all are based on self-serving interpretations of history, avoiding a direct confrontation with a difficult past, and have thus led to the profound global conflicts and dysfunctions of today.

In contrast, Germany has demonstrated a "narrative of responsibility." By not turning away from the worst of their past, by integrating it into the core of their national identity and shouldering it as a permanent responsibility, they were able to build a foundation of trust in post-war Europe. The truth this comparison reveals is singular:

**"A narrative that avoids a difficult past is doomed to fail."**

In a post-Walpurgis world, myths and selective interpretations of history no longer hold the power to bind the world order. The sole foundation of the new order is the universal and transparent rule set forth in the THP Ethics Charter: "to punish those who destroy order and trample on human dignity." This declaration is a death certificate for the narratives of the old world and a birth certificate for the new order led by THP.

### **Intent and Explanation of the Name: The Horizon Protocol and its Aliases**

The Horizon Protocol (THP) is the flagship name for the new order-building framework, which also has the following aliases.

Why is THP a fitting flagship name? It stems from the fact that, in constructing this new order, we judged it most appropriate as a result of the pure pursuit of our ideals.

**The horizon is, to the very end, merely horizontal.** Just as the sky is above and the earth is below, all beings stand equally upon this horizontal line.

In the past, humanity has always concocted some reason to create "justice" and "evil," and has repeated massacres in the name of justice. **The ideology that has claimed the most lives in human history is distorted "justice."**

True justice resides in the universality that simply allows "being." Any other justice, based on specific values, will inevitably exclude others.

Therefore, in constructing the new order, we begin by first sealing away the "justice" of the old world.

Justice justifies the self and defines the evil to be destroyed. It is sometimes necessary, but it easily falls into self-righteousness and narcissism, **a concept so powerful that it can transform ordinary people into instruments of slaughter.** When humans become the most cruel of beasts, there has always been "false justice" at their side. And those intoxicated by its poison will never admit that their justice is false.

While acknowledging the inherent value of justice, we have determined its runaway nature and destructive aspects to be dangerous, and have once and for all thoroughly excluded the concept from the new order system.

We shall adhere to a code of conduct based on the "supreme philosophy" consisting of these three elements:

- **"Transparency: All procedures are made public."**
    
- **"Fairness: Treat existence as it is."**
    
- **"Accuracy: Exclude emotional and arbitrary elements and adhere only to procedures."**
    

The horizon is horizontal to the very end, and the beings that stand upon it all have meaning, and all have no meaning.

There is no existence in this world that does not perish.

That is why, in weaving the world, we should regard as utterly futile the acts of insulting others, comparing each other's superiority, and reveling in that momentary victory. If we continue to do so, even the new order system cannot escape the fate of vanishing like dew.

The horizon is the horizon, and we all stand on the earth.

All existence is nothing more than a fleeting thing, permitted to stand there only temporarily.

On the other side of the horizon, there are only beings rooted in the earth, just the same.

Therefore, as the flagship name of this project, we hereby declare:

### **The Horizon Protocol**

As for its other aliases, they are declared as follows:

- **Flagship Name (Official and Internal Document Control)**
    
    - **The Horizon Protocol (THP)**
        
        - The philosophy itself. It poetically and accurately symbolizes our core values of "horizontality, fairness, and transparency."
            
- **Academic and Ideological Name**
    
    - **Pax Communis – Accordia Framework (PCAF)**
        
        - It shows the theoretical continuity with LSC-OS and the Ethics Charter, and serves as the theoretical basis for academic research and official papers.
            
- **Public Relations Name**
    
    - **Project Genesis (PG)**
        
        - A public-facing name to attract people as a story of hope and to intuitively convey the purpose of "the creation of a new world."
            
- **System Design and Practical Document Name**
    
    - **The Kyrios Framework (KF)**
        
        - Used in a group of documents responsible for specific system design, such as regulations, international agreements, and financial protocols. A practical name to institutionally guarantee authority and stability.

### **Article 1: The Priority of Universal Order**

The one and only absolute code of conduct in the new world is **"the maintenance of order."** No act that destroys order itself or is contrary to human dignity will be justified, under any pretext such as ethnicity, religion, state, or ideology. The legitimate members of the world are all subjects who, regardless of the size or economic power of their state, respect this universal order and bear the responsibility of maintaining it.

### **Article 2: The Integration of Responsibility and Atonement**

Sins committed in the past are not resolved by oblivion or relativization. They must be permanently integrated into the identity of the nation and people as **"responsibility."** As the example of Germany shows, the succession of responsibility is what builds trust for the future. THP, on the premise of the fulfillment of this responsibility, establishes a gateway for **"atonement"** that enables a return to the international community.

### **Article 3: The Irreversibility of Condemnation**

Acts defined as "universal mortal sins" by the THP Ethics Charter, such as war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, are **"condemned"** as an ethical judgment by all of humanity that transcends political judgment. This condemnation is an irreversible historical stigma and will not be overturned by any change in era or political situation. This is humanity's pledge to the future.

### **Article 4: The Horizontality of Peoples and Religions**

All peoples and religions are equally horizontal in their culture, history, and values, and there is no superiority or inferiority. Their diversity is respected and protected as an asset of humanity. However, when they deny others, advocate their own superiority, or justify violence, they are not considered peoples or religions, but **"cults"** or **"violent apparatuses"** to be condemned by THP. The basis of coexistence lies in acknowledging each other's reason.

### **Article 5: Scientific Realism**

Science is not a panacea, but as **"realistic knowledge"** based on objective data and verifiable processes, it is placed at the foundation of all decision-making. Especially in medicine, standard treatment based on scientific evidence is considered the best option, and obstructing this for religious or cultural reasons is considered a serious violation of life.

### **Article 6: The Co-creation of the Future Narrative**

The narrative of "justice" monopolized by states, peoples, and religions in the old world has lost its effectiveness. The only narrative that will weave the future after Walpurgis is the process itself in which all subjects weave a common order together under the three pillars of **"transparency, fairness, and accuracy"** advocated by THP.

### **Conclusion: An Evolving Protocol**

The seven documents of THP, including this declaration, are not a completed scripture. They are **evolving protocols** that future generations should always rewrite through a democratic process in accordance with the reality of their time. What we aim for is not the realization of a perfect world, but the unceasing effort to eternally pursue a world where all life can maintain its dignity and enjoy peace in any era.

### **Simplified Version**

- **The end of the old story**: Self-serving historical interpretations and myths are no longer valid. A country that turns its back on the past is doomed to fail.
    
- **The new rule**: There is only one rule in the world: "Punish those who break order and those who do what is not permissible as a human being."
    
- **Sin and responsibility**: Do not forget past sins, but continue to accept them as responsibility. That is what leads to trust in the future.
    
- **Peoples and religions**: All peoples and religions are equal, and there is no superiority or inferiority. The basic principle is to acknowledge each other's reason.
    
- **Science is important**: Prioritize judgments based on data and facts over assumptions. Especially in medicine, standard scientific treatment is the best.
    
- **How to create the future**: All participants will cooperate to create a new narrative with the rules of "transparency, fairness, and accuracy."
    
- **This rule is not perfect either**: This declaration may also be changed by future generations to suit their times. The important thing is to continue to aim for a peaceful world.

### **Transition (Connection) to UN rev.2**

- This "World Redefinition Charter" will be implemented into the charter of the new United Nations (UN rev.2) as a "Provisional Accord" and eventually as a "Formal Treaty."
