# THP-2-S1 E-MAD Score Detailed Design Document

## 1. Purpose and Background

E-MAD (Effective Multilateral Assured Denial) is an economic conviction protocol designed to completely nullify all benefits derived from actions that violate the THP Ethics Charter (= universal high crimes) and to inflict irrecoverable damage upon the acting entity.

This design document defines the specific calculation logic and operational methods for the core "E-MAD Score."

## 2. E-MAD Score Basic Design

The E-MAD Score is a numerical value from 0 to 100 that quantitatively indicates the severity of a "universal high crime" committed by a state, organization, or individual. The higher the score, the more severe the crime is considered, and the more powerful the economic sanctions imposed.

### 2.1. Calculation Formula Overview

```
E-MAD Score = (Î£ (Base Impact[i] * Contextual Multiplier[i])) + Cumulative Penalty - Mitigation Credit
```

- **Base Impact**: The severity of the act itself.
- **Contextual Multiplier**: The circumstances and intent under which the act was committed.
- **Cumulative Penalty**: Additions for past violations.
- **Mitigation Credit**: Reductions for actions taken to atone for the crime.

### 2.2. Detailed Calculation Items

#### a) Base Impact (0-100)
The Ethics Tribunal adjudicates based on the following criteria:
- **Category 1 (80-100):** Acts that threaten the very survival of civilization, such as genocide, first use of nuclear weapons, intentional destruction of life-sustaining infrastructure.
- **Category 2 (50-79):** Wars of aggression, large-scale crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing.
- **Category 3 (20-49):** Interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, paralysis of social infrastructure through cyber-attacks, large-scale social disruption through the dissemination of disinformation.
- **Category 4 (1-19):** Intentional manipulation of financial markets, environmental destruction, destruction of cultural heritage.

#### b) Contextual Multiplier (0.5 - 2.0)
- **Premeditation:** Was the act planned and organized? (x1.5 - 2.0)
- **Cruelty:** Were inhumane methods used? (x1.2 - 1.8)
- **Scope of Impact:** Did the damage affect a wide area? (x1.1 - 1.5)
- **Claim of Self-Defense:** Did the act exceed the scope of legitimate self-defense? (x0.5 - 1.0) *Multiplier is lower if legitimacy is recognized.

#### c) Cumulative Penalty
- If an E-MAD score has been assigned within the last 5 years, 20% of the previous score is added.

#### d) Mitigation Credit
- **Reparations to Victims:** Full compensation for the amount of damage. (Max -30)
- **Punishment of Responsible Parties:** Prosecution and punishment of responsible parties under domestic and international law. (Max -20)
- **Implementation of Recurrence Prevention Measures:** Introduction of effective recurrence prevention measures, audited by a third-party organization. (Max -15)
- **Contribution to the International Community:** Participation in the UN-PDF, contribution of funds to the Peace Fund, etc. (Max -10)

## 3. Sanction Levels According to Score

| Score | Sanction Level | Key Sanctions |
|---|---|---|
| 80-100 | **Level 5: Complete Conviction** | - Total asset freeze, complete exclusion from the international financial system<br>- Exclusion from the JIMS corridor (except for humanitarian aid)<br>- Target for military action by UN-PDF |
| 60-79 | **Level 4: Strict Isolation** | - Freeze of major assets, exclusion from SWIFT<br>- Embargo on specific items<br>- Possibility of a naval blockade by UN-PDF |
| 40-59 | **Level 3: High Sanctions** | - Asset freeze on government officials and related companies<br>- Prohibition of investment in specific sectors<br>- Arms embargo |
| 20-39 | **Level 2: Limited Sanctions** | - Asset freeze and travel ban on specific individuals<br>- Embargo on luxury goods |
| 1-19 | **Level 1: Warning** | - Diplomatic condemnation<br>- Regular monitoring by the Ethics Council |

## 4. Operational Flow

1.  **Petition:** The victim state or ICPO-2 files a petition with the Ethics Tribunal.
2.  **Hearing:** The Ethics Tribunal conducts fact-finding and evidence gathering.
3.  **Judgment:** The Ethics Tribunal calculates the E-MAD score and delivers a judgment.
4.  **Pronouncement:** The judgment is final-pronounced in the name of the Ethics Council.
5.  **Execution:** The New Financial Order Council and the UN-PDF automatically execute sanctions corresponding to the score.
6.  **Review:** If actions eligible for mitigation credits are confirmed, the Ethics Tribunal reviews the score.
