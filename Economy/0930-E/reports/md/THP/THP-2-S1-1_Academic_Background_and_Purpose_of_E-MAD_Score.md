# Academic Background and Purpose of the E-MAD Score

## 1. Introduction: The Philosophy of The Horizon Protocol (THP) and the E-MAD Score

**The Horizon Protocol (THP)** is a comprehensive ideological system that aims for a prosperity that integrates not only economic growth but also social justice, environmental sustainability, and individual well-being. In realizing this philosophy, a scale that objectively and quantitatively evaluates the negative impacts on society and the environment is essential.

The **E-MAD (Economically-Mutually Assured Destruction) Score** is an evaluation framework designed to quantify the negative impacts of organizational activities on society and the environment, based on this THP philosophy. Its purpose is not simply to impose penalties, but to visualize negative impacts and design incentives for organizations to regulate their own behavior and transition to a better socioeconomic system.

This framework is positioned as a theoretical and practical tool to clarify how the actions of individual organizations contribute to global challenges such as climate change, human rights violations, and financial system instability, and to ensure accountability.

## 2. Design Philosophy and Architecture: Adoption of a Two-Stage Evaluation Model

The E-MAD score adopts a **two-stage architecture that separates "objective damage assessment" and "contextual factor assessment"** as its core design philosophy. This is an application of best practices established in fields that require a high degree of fairness and objectivity, such as sentencing in law (judging the illegality of an act and the degree of responsibility separately) and credit risk assessment models in financial engineering.

1. **First Stage: Calculation of the Foundational Damage Score (F-Score)**
    
    - The objective magnitude of the damage caused by an incident is evaluated from the three aspects of human, environmental, and governance. At this stage, subjective and contextual factors such as the actor's intent and the size of the organization are intentionally excluded, and only the pure "magnitude of damage" is quantified.
        
2. **Second Stage: Score Adjustment by a Multiplying Factor (M-Factor)**
    
    - The foundational score calculated in the first stage is multiplied by two adjustment factors: "Intent" and "Scale." This reflects the context in the score, such as whether it was due to negligence or intentional, and whether the impact was localized or widespread.
        

This two-stage separation architecture improves the transparency of the evaluation and ensures auditability and accountability for the question of "why that score was given."

## 3. Consistency with International Norms: Legitimacy and Global Applicability of the Score

The evaluation criteria for the E-MAD score are not arbitrary, but clearly comply with internationally widely agreed-upon norms and principles. This ensures the legitimacy of the score and its applicability in a global context.

The main sources of compliance are as follows:

- **United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)**: 10 principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.
    
- **International Labour Organization (ILO) Core Labour Standards**: Prohibition of forced labor, child labor, and elimination of discrimination.
    
- **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises**: Standards for responsible business conduct regarding human rights, environment, and information disclosure.
    
- **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)**: The global standard for sustainability reporting.
    

By placing these international frameworks at the core of the evaluation, the E-MAD score reflects universal ethical standards that are not dependent on specific cultures or values.

|E-MAD Category|Indicator (Example)|Related SDGs|Related UNGC Principles|Related ILO Core Conventions|Related OECD Guidelines|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Human Impact (HUM)**|`HUM-02` Labor Rights Violations|8: Decent Work and Economic Growth|3, 4, 5, 6|C87, C98, C29, C105, C138, C182, C100, C111|V. Employment and Industrial Relations|
||`HUM-03` Human Rights Violations|16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions|1, 2|-|IV. Human Rights|
|**Environmental Impact (ENV)**|`ENV-01` Ecosystem Damage|14: Life Below Water, 15: Life on Land|8, 9|-|VI. Environment|
||`ENV-05` Violation of the Precautionary Principle|12: Responsible Consumption and Production|7|-|VI. Environment|
|**Governance (GOV)**|`GOV-01` Corruption and Bribery|16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions|10|-|VII. Combating Bribery, Bribe Solicitation and Extortion|
||`GOV-02` Anti-competitive Practices|8: Decent Work and Economic Growth|-|-|VIII. Competition|

This matrix shows that the E-MAD score is not a standalone standard, but is closely linked to and complements and strengthens existing international frameworks, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
