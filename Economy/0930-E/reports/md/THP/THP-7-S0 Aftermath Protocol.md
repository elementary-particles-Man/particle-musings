# THP-7-S0 Aftermath Protocol v1.0

## 1. Activation Condition

This protocol is activated immediately and automatically when **Gate-D (DEATH / TERMINAL)** is declared on the `THP-7 Ops-KPI Dashboard`. This signifies that "recovery" of the existing system is impossible, and all resources are to be shifted to the "establishment of an alternative system."

## 2. Operational Packages

### A) Emergency JPY Payroll Facility (E-JPF)

- **Objective:** To guarantee the salary payments for personnel essential to maintaining civilization's critical infrastructure—such as power, water, healthcare, communications, and food supply—and to prevent a complete shutdown of Grid Management (GM).
    
- **Design:**
    
    1. **Unit of Claim:** All claims shall use the **Japanese Yen (JPY)** as the numeraire (unit of account). To stabilize its value, Gold will be used as an anchor asset, with a discipline band established (e.g., 20–30% Gold / 70–80% JPY).
        
    2. **Payment Forms:**
        
        - **JPY Vouchers:** Purpose-specific vouchers usable only for purchasing lifeline goods (food, fuel, etc.).
            
        - **Mobile QR Payments:** A QR code payment system usable even offline.
            
        - **Paper Certificates:** A backup for when digital infrastructure fails.
            
    3. **Settlement:** Payments to suppliers of goods will be settled based on the **JPY-Parities** described below. If the banking system becomes dysfunctional, settlement will be guaranteed through intergovernmental clearing via the JIMS corridor (Japan–India–Malaysia–Singapore).
        
    4. **Control and Audit:** Usage will be strictly limited by MCC (Merchant Category Code) controls. Identity verification will comply with the WAU/KAIRO-P protocol, and all transactions will be auditable on a public ledger (Witness-Only).
        
- **Duration:** A provisional measure lasting up to **T+90 days** after activation. Extensions will be at the discretion of THP Command.
    

### B) Publication of JPY-Parities (Provisional Fix)

- **Objective:** To re-establish an anchor for the international price system amidst the chaos of a collapsed U.S. dollar as a unit of account, thereby preventing a regression to a barter economy. This is not about price control but about providing a **coordinate system** for accounting and settlement.
    
- **Content:** The following provisional fixed prices (Parities) in Japanese Yen for major goods and assets will be published:
    
    - **JG-Par:** JPY/Gold
        
    - **JS-Par:** JPY/Silver
        
    - **JOIL-Par:** JPY/WTI (Crude Oil)
        
    - **JGR-Par:** JPY/Grain (Major grain basket)
        
    - **JWA-Par:** JPY/Water (Based on desalination and transport costs)
        

### C) L/C Government Guarantee + Reinsurance Pool

- **Objective:** To unfreeze international trade finance and resume the international transport of lifeline resources.
    
- **Operation:**
    
    1. **Scope:** Limited to items related to the four sectors: water, medicine, power, and food.
        
    2. **Guarantee:** The Government of Japan will provide a 100% guarantee for letters of credit (L/C), making maximum use of the existing legal authorities of MOF/JBIC/JICA.
        
    3. **Reinsurance:** A reinsurance pool will be established, starting with Japan and in coordination with India and Singapore, to cover risks such as war and political upheaval.
        
    4. **Settlement:** All settlements will be conducted in JPY, with net settlement of balances between governments through the JIMS corridor. Contract clauses will explicitly **prohibit pseudo-dollarization** (exchanging to dollars immediately after the transaction).
        

### D) Grid Blackstart Shield

- **Objective:** To prevent the collapse of the **"recovery systems"** themselves, which are involved in restoring and maintaining the power grid.
    
- **Operation:**
    
    1. **Protection of Minimum Personnel:** A list of minimum essential personnel required for maintaining and restarting the power system will be created as the "black frame," and their salary payments via E-JPF will be given the highest priority.
        
    2. **Securing Fuel Corridors:** Fuel transport routes to power plants will be designated as "humanitarian corridors," ensuring escort by UN-PDF and top priority in customs processes.
        
    3. **Communication Redundancy:** To maintain the chain of command, redundancy of communication means such as radio, satellite, and emergency power sources will be ensured.
        

## 3. Narrative and Compliance

### A) Basic Messaging (Internal and External)

1. **"The Unit of Account is the Yen, the Lifeline Corridor is Public"** — Not aiming for new hegemony, but building trust in the international community through auditable transparency.
    
2. **"Support the City, Not the Regime"** — Aid is limited to infrastructure maintenance personnel, preventing diversion to military or security agencies through purpose-specific vouchers.
    
3. **"Time-bound, Quantity-limited, Logs Public"** — All interventions are provisional and politicization is avoided through Witness-Only public audits.
    

### B) Prohibitive/Deterrent Clauses (Contractual Compliance)

- **Shadow-USD Clause:** Contracts will prohibit the immediate exchange of JPY-denominated settlements into dollars or dollar-denominated hedging. If a violation is discovered, a full clawback (demand for repayment) of the guaranteed funds will be initiated.
    
- **Military Non-diversion Clause:** Parties must swear that supplied goods will be used for civilian purposes only and agree to unannounced on-site audits.
    
- **Public Audit Clause:** All transaction logs will, in principle, be made public after hashing personal information.
    

## 4. Timeline (T-0 to T+90)

- **T-0 to +72h:** Gate-D determination. Provisional JPY-Parities are published. E-JPF is initiated for the first five sectors (power, water, medicine, communications, food).
    
- **T+7d:** The L/C government guarantee + reinsurance pool becomes fully operational. Escort for fuel corridors begins.
    
- **T+14d:** EUR-R⇄JPY snap-lock is introduced. Settlement fluctuations with the remaining functional parts of the Eurozone are suppressed by setting time windows.
    
- **T+30 to 90d:** Clearing bridges with ASEAN, India (INR), and Brazil (BRL) are progressively connected. The Gold-JPY discipline band (equivalent to a 20-30% reserve ratio) is formally announced.
