# THP-7-S0 Aftermath Protocol v1.0

## 1. Activation Conditions

This protocol is activated immediately and automatically when **Gate-D (DEATH / TERMINAL)** is declared on the `THP-7 Ops-KPI Dashboard`. This means that "recovery" of the existing system is impossible, and all resources will be shifted to "establishing a new, separate system."

## 2. Operational Packages

### A) Emergency JPY Payroll Facility (E-JPF)

- **Objective:** To guarantee the salary payments of personnel responsible for infrastructure essential for the maintenance of civilization, such as electricity, water, medical care, communications, and food supply, and to prevent a complete shutdown of Grid Management (GM).
    
- **Design:**
    
    1. **Unit of Claim:** All claims shall be denominated in **Japanese Yen (JPY)** as the numeraire. To stabilize its value, gold will be used as an anchor asset, and a discipline band (e.g., 20–30% Gold / 70–80% JPY) will be established.
        
    2. **Payment Methods:**
        
        - **JPY Vouchers:** Use-restricted type that can only be used to purchase lifeline goods (food, fuel, etc.).
            
        - **Mobile QR Payments:** A QR code payment system that can be used even offline.
            
        - **Paper Vouchers:** A backup in case the digital infrastructure fails.
            
    3. **Settlement:** Payments to goods suppliers will be settled based on the **JPY-Parities** described below. If the banking system becomes dysfunctional, settlement will be guaranteed through intergovernmental clearing via the JIMS corridor (Japan–India–Malaysia–Singapore).
        
    4. **Control and Audit:** Use is strictly limited by MCC (Merchant Category Code) control. Identity verification will comply with the WAU/KAIRO-P protocol, and all transactions will be auditable on a public ledger (Witness-Only).
        
- **Duration:** This is a provisional measure for up to **T+90 days** after activation. Extension will be at the discretion of THP Command.
    

### B) Publication of JPY-Parities (Provisional Fix)

- **Objective:** To reset the anchor of the international price system and prevent a regression to barter in the midst of the chaos of the collapse of the US dollar as a unit of account. This is not to control prices, but to provide a **coordinate** for accounting and settlement.
    
- **Content:** The following provisional fixed prices (Parity) in Japanese Yen for major goods and assets will be published.
    
    - **JG-Par:** JPY/Gold
        
    - **JS-Par:** JPY/Silver
        
    - **JOIL-Par:** JPY/WTI (Crude Oil)
        
    - **JGR-Par:** JPY/Grain (Major Grain Basket)
        
    - **JWA-Par:** JPY/Water (Desalination and Transportation Cost Basis)
        

### C) L/C Government Guarantee + Reinsurance Pool

- **Objective:** To unfreeze international trade finance and resume the international transport of lifeline resources.
    
- **Operation:**
    
    1. **Scope:** Limited to items related to the four sectors of water, medical care, electricity, and food.
        
    2. **Guarantee:** The Japanese government will 100% guarantee letters of credit (L/C) by making maximum use of the existing legal authority of MOF/JBIC/JICA.
        
    3. **Reinsurance:** A reinsurance pool will be created, starting with Japan and in coordination with India and Singapore, to cover the risks of war and political upheaval.
        
    4. **Settlement:** All settlements will be made in yen, and net settlements will be made between governments through the JIMS corridor. The contract terms will explicitly prohibit **pseudo-dollarization (exchange to dollars immediately after the transaction)**.
        

### D) Grid Blackstart Shield

- **Objective:** To prevent the collapse of the **"recovery system"** itself, which is involved in the restoration and maintenance of the grid (power grid).
    
- **Operation:**
    
    1. **Protection of Minimum Personnel:** The minimum number of personnel required to maintain and restart the power system will be listed as a "black frame," and their salary payments will be guaranteed with the highest priority by the E-JPF.
        
    2. **Securing Fuel Corridors:** Fuel transport routes to power plants will be designated as "humanitarian corridors," and escort by the UN-PDF and top priority treatment in customs procedures will be guaranteed.
        
    3. **Redundancy of Communications:** To maintain the command and control system, redundancy of communication means such as radio, satellite, and emergency power supplies will be secured.
        

## 3. Narrative and Compliance

### A) Basic Message (for internal and external audiences)

1. **"The unit of account is the yen, the corridor of life is public"** — We will not aim for new hegemony, but will build the trust of the international community through auditable transparency.
    
2. **"Support the city, not the regime"** — Support will be limited to infrastructure maintenance personnel, and the diversion to military and security agencies will be prevented by use-restricted vouchers.
    
3. **"Time-limited, quantity-limited, log-public"** — All interventions are provisional, and politicization will be avoided through Witness-Only public audits.
    

### B) Prohibitory and Deterrent Clauses (Contract Compliance)

- **Shadow-USD Clause:** The contract prohibits the immediate exchange of yen-denominated settlements for dollars or dollar-denominated hedges. If a violation is discovered, a full clawback (claim for refund) of the guaranteed funds will be made.
    
- **Non-Military Use Clause:** The supplied goods will be sworn to be used only for civilian purposes, and consent will be given to unannounced on-site audits.
    
- **Public Audit Clause:** All transaction logs will be made public in principle, after hashing personal information.
    

## 4. Timeline (T-0 to T+90)

- **T-0 to +72h:** Gate-D determination. Publication of the provisional fix for JPY-Parities. E-JPF will be launched in the five leading industries (electricity, water, medical care, communications, and food).
    
- **T+7d:** The L/C government guarantee + reinsurance pool will be fully operational. Escort of fuel corridors will begin.
    
- **T+14d:** Introduction of the EUR-R⇄JPY snap lock. Settlement fluctuations with the remaining functions of the Eurozone will be suppressed by setting a time window.
    
- **T+30 to 90d:** Clearing bridges with ASEAN, India (INR), and Brazil (BRL) will be connected in stages. The Gold-JPY discipline band (equivalent to a reserve ratio of 20-30%) will be officially announced.
