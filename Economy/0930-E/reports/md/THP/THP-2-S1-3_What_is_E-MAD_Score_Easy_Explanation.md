# What is the E-MAD Score? A New Ruler to Measure Corporate "Screw-ups"

## 1. What is the E-MAD Score in a nutshell?

The E-MAD (Economically-Mutually Assured Destruction) score is a **new "ruler" for expressing in points** how much "negative impact" a company or organization has had on society and the environment.

The higher the score, the higher the "screw-up level," meaning the greater the damage to society and the environment.

The purpose of this score is not just to punish companies that have done wrong. It is a tool for creating a common rule for society as a whole to "stop doing this kind of thing" and aiming for a future where everyone becomes more prosperous, called **"The Horizon Protocol (THP)"**.

## 2. Why is such a score necessary?

There is no end to companies in the world that pollute the environment, treat their employees unfairly, or break the rules of society. Such actions threaten our lives and the future of the planet.

However, it is a very difficult problem to objectively judge "how bad is it?" The E-MAD score visualizes the problem by showing the "magnitude of the negative impact" with a **score from 0 to 100** that is easy for anyone to understand.

This allows us to judge which companies are behaving well and which are engaging in problematic behavior based on objective criteria.

## 3. How is the score determined? 3 points

The E-MAD score is calculated by multiplying three main factors.

### Point 1: Magnitude of Damage (Base Score)

First, the amount of damage caused by the action is converted into points. This is the "base score" that forms the basis of the score. The following three aspects are evaluated:

- **Impact on People (Human)**: How much did it harm people's lives, health, and human rights?
    
- **Impact on the Environment (Environment)**: How much did it destroy nature and ecosystems?
    
- **Impact on Social Rules (Governance)**: How much did it damage the trust of society by lying or committing fraud?
    

### Point 2: Was it intentional? (Intent)

Next, it is evaluated whether the action was "intentional" or "accidental."

- **Intentional/Planned** → The score will be **higher**.
    
- **Accidental Mistake** → The score will be **lower**.
    

Naturally, actions done with malicious intent should be held to a higher standard of responsibility.

### Point 3: Scope of Impact (Scale)

Finally, the extent of the impact of the action is evaluated.

- **Global Impact** → The score will be **higher**.
    
- **Problem in a very limited area** → The score will be **lower**.
    

For example, the seriousness of the problem changes greatly depending on whether the wastewater from a certain factory polluted only the adjacent river or flowed into the sea and affected fish all over the world.

## 4. Concrete Image

For example, it's like this.

- **Case A: A small, careless mistake**
    
    - A restaurant made a mistake in its allergy labeling by accident. Fortunately, there were no health problems.
        
    - **Result** → The E-MAD score will be a **low score**. This is because the damage was small, it was not intentional, and the scope of the impact was limited.
        
- **Case B: Large-scale intentional pollution**
    
    - A large company concealed the fact that it was discharging harmful chemicals into a river to cut costs. As a result, it caused widespread environmental pollution and health problems for many residents.
        
    - **Result** → The E-MAD score will be a **very high score**. This is because the damage was large, it was intentional, and the scope of the impact was wide.
        

In this way, the E-MAD score is a powerful tool for evaluating various problems that occur in society with fair and easy-to-understand criteria.
