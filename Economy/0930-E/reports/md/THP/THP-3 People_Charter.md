# People-Charter

## Detailed Version

### Preface: Redefining Ethnicity
The history of the 20th century has been a tragedy in which ethnicity, linked to the "state" in the name of nationalism, has justified superiority over others and repeatedly become a source of conflict. The Horizon Protocol (THP) declares the liquidation of this mistake and the liberation of ethnicity from the yoke of the state and territory. Ethnicity in this charter is defined as a human group that shares history, culture, and language, and serves as a source of individual identity and spiritual support. All ethnic groups, regardless of their size or the length of their history, are respected as equally horizontal beings.

### Article 1: Freedom of Ethnic Affiliation
All individuals have the right to freely choose the ethnic group with which they identify and to inherit its culture and pride. Ethnic identity is not something forced by birth or lineage, but is part of the right to self-determination based on individual dignity. The state shall not infringe on this freedom for any reason.

### Article 2: Protection of Culture and Tradition
The unique cultures, languages, and traditions nurtured by each ethnic group are the intangible assets of all humanity. THP will support the protection and inheritance of these assets if they are in danger of extinction. However, this does not apply if the tradition conflicts with the THP Ethics Charter (e.g., violates human rights).

### Article 3: Duty of Mutual Respect and Prohibition of Discrimination and Attack
People belonging to different ethnic groups have a duty to respect each other's values and history. The act of trying to establish the identity of one ethnic group through attacks, discrimination, or distortion/denial of the history of another ethnic group is considered a serious violation that destroys the world order.

### Article 4: Complete Denial of Supremacist Ideology
No ethnic group shall claim to be superior to or more special than any other ethnic group. All forms of ethnic supremacist ideology based on historical circumstances, economic power, or cultural influence are the root of the tragedies of the 20th century and will never be tolerated in the world of THP. There is no hierarchy among ethnic groups, only horizontal diversity.

### Article 5: The Principle of Coexistence and the Degeneration into Violence
Ethnicity functions as a positive community that saves individuals from loneliness and fosters a rich culture. However, when that energy is directed towards hatred of other ethnic groups or the plunder of resources, it is judged to have degenerated into a "violent apparatus" that should be condemned based on the THP Ethics Charter, and is no longer an ethnic group.

### Conclusion
This charter is a guidepost for transforming ethnicity from a tool of conflict into a foundation that celebrates cultural diversity and supports the coexistence of humanity.

## Simplified Version

- **Ethnicity is free and equal**: There is no hierarchy among ethnic groups, everyone is equal. You can decide your own ethnicity.
- **Culture is everyone's treasure**: The cultures and languages of various ethnic groups are treasured as the treasure of all humanity.
- **Respect each other**: It is absolutely forbidden to make fun of, attack, or discriminate against other ethnic groups.
- **"We are the best" is prohibited**: Thinking that "our ethnic group is special" is prohibited because it is a source of conflict.
- **Violence is not allowed**: Ethnicity should not be used as a tool to hurt others.

## Footnote: Authority of the Four Sages
The Four Sages are an **advisory body (no vote)** and have **no voting rights** in the PMC and the Council of Ethics.

## Organizational Alignment (Council / Court / Four Sages)
- **The final judgment is in the name of the Council of Ethics**.
- Court of Ethics: Judiciary (litigation procedures, sentencing).
- The Four Sages: **Advisory (no vote)**.

## Operational Principles (Priorities)
- This charter guarantees "freedom of ethnic affiliation and protection of culture." However, universal human rights (Ethics Charter) > religious/cultural customs > administrative discretion in that order of priority.
- The rights of the individual take precedence over the rights of the group (including the protection of children, women, and minorities).
- The three principles of intervention: minimum necessary, proportionality, and reversibility.

## Examination and Execution Procedures for Ethnic Self-Determination (Operational Protocol)
1) Acceptance of Petition: Only petitions that meet the acceptance requirements of representativeness, denial of violence, and observance of basic human rights will be examined.
2) Protective Measures: A provisional order for "prohibition of retaliation and suspension of forced relocation" can be issued at the same time as the petition.
3) Impact Assessment: Integrated assessment of population, living area, infrastructure, and finance (within 60 days).
4) Option Design: Presentation of a phased plan of a. cultural autonomy / b. wide-area autonomy (finance, education) / c. federalization / d. separation and independence.
5) Confirmation of Residents' Will: Fair voting under international supervision (two rounds of voting: draft plan → final plan).
6) Provisional Autonomy: The rules for the transitional government, joint security, and apportionment of shared assets will be finalized in a provisional agreement.
7) Final Peace Agreement: Human rights clauses, protection of minorities, and cross-border traffic (residence, commerce) will be made into a treaty.
8) Supervision: JIMS/ICPO-2 will monitor. Serious violations are subject to E-MAD and UN-PDF.

## Historical Hatred Liquidation Protocol (TRC + Reparations)
- Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC): Fact-finding of perpetration and damage, preservation of testimony, public hearings.
- Restorative Measures: A combination of restitution, alternative compensation, and joint management (holy sites, water rights, cemeteries).
- Inviolable Corridors: Application of non-use of force to religious facilities, medical care, and education. Violations are subject to E-MAD Phase 2 (blocking of funds, insurance, and distribution).
- Time-limited Supervision: Evaluation every 3 years, with strengthened sanctions for no improvement.

## The Boundary between the Protection of Culture and Universal Human Rights (List of Prohibited Practices)
#### See Lexicon
- Based on "Universal Human Rights" [THP-5: Lexicon], this "List of Prohibited Practices" is binding.
- Basis for application: Human rights are not inherent, but are granted in two layers: "the group to which one belongs + the consensus of all humanity" (THP-2 Article 0).

- Absolute Prohibition: Child marriage / female genital mutilation (FGM) / honor killings / forced conversion/apostasy penalties / slave labor / corporal punishment.
- Conditional Acceptance: Costumes, dietary rules, and rituals are protected to the extent that they do not violate individual freedom.
- Enforcement: Violations are dealt with in the order of domestic law → ICPO-2 cross-border inquiry → Court of Ethics → E-MAD.

## Case Study Template (Operational Template)
- Case A: Overlapping claims of settlements and indigenous peoples
  1) Immediate ceasefire/inviolable corridor → 2) Joint management → 3) Clause for shelving ownership → 4) Optional system of phased return/compensation.
- Case B: Request for separation of a multi-ethnic autonomous province
  1) Examination of acceptance requirements → 2) Wide-area autonomy (finance, education) → 3) Internationally supervised referendum → 4) Final treaty of federalization or independence.
- Case C: Conflict between religious customs and child protection
  1) Emergency protection order → 2) Cultural substitution (replacement of symbols) → 3) Supervised compliance plan → 4) Sanction ladder for violations.

## KPI / Escalation Conditions (Connection to Ops-KPI)
- Forced Relocation: Over 10,000 people in 7 days = warning. Over 30,000 people = E-MAD Phase 1 (financial restrictions).
- Civilian Casualties: Over 5 cases per 100,000 people per week = warning. Over 20 cases = review for dispatch of UN-PDF.
- Attacks on Religious Facilities: 1 case = alert, 3 consecutive cases = E-MAD Phase 1 + ICPO-2 international wanted list.
- Non-fulfillment of Agreement: Automatic activation of asset freeze and insurance rate increase for 2 consecutive periods of non-compliance in supervision evaluation.

## Organizational Arrangement and Authority (People's Mediation Committee / PMC)
- PMC (People's Mediation Committee): A specialized committee under JIMS. Cases are examined in subcommittees for human rights, finance, geopolitics, and religion.
- Authority: Recommendation of provisional orders, establishment of TRC, design of referendums. The final judgment is in the name of the Council of Ethics, and judicial procedures are handled by the Court of Ethics.
- Cooperation: ICPO-2 (cross-border inquiry of violators), UN-PDF (corridor security), New Financial Order Council (sanction implementation).
