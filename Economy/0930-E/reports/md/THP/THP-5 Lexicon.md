# THP-5: Lexicon (Unified Version)

This lexicon describes the main concepts in The Horizon Protocol (THP) in a two-tiered structure of **academic version (strict definition)** and **explanatory version (plain explanation)**.
Each term clearly indicates the reference relationship with the **article number of the THP-2 Ethics Charter** and related charters and appendices.

---

## Humanity / Ethics [See: THP-2 Preface, Article 1]

- Academic Version
    "Humanity" is a protective wall necessary for humans to exist as "humans," and is the foundation of collective self-defense against the law-of-the-jungle environment of reality. Order is maintained by making this humanity the sole standard and classifying sins into atonement and condemnation.

- Explanatory Version
    Humanity is "the path to be followed as a person." It is like a wall that protects everyone from a harsh world. The act of breaking the wall is a "sin," and if you atone for it, you can return inside (atonement), and if you are deemed unforgivable, you will be exiled (condemnation).

---

## Order [See: THP-2 Preface]

- Academic Version
    Order refers to the mechanism for maintaining collective self-defense through atonement and condemnation, with humanity as the sole standard. The internal norms of individual groups are left to the discretion of the subject, but on a human scale, a universal order based on humanity is applied.

- Explanatory Version
    Order is "the mechanism for surviving together by following the rules of humanity." Each country and organization can have its own rules, but for humanity as a whole, "humanity" is the common rule.

---

## Human Rights [See: THP-2 Article 0]

- Academic Version
    Human rights are not inherent, but are granted to subjects who protect humanity through a two-tiered procedure of (1) the agreement of the group to which they belong, and (2) the agreement of all humanity. Acts that deviate from humanity deny human rights and are placed outside of collective self-defense.

- Explanatory Version
    Human rights are not "innate," but "something that everyone gives to those who protect humanity." Human rights exist only after the country and society to which a person belongs first recognizes them, and all of humanity agrees that "that is fine."

---

## Universal Human Rights [See: THP-2 Article 0 / THP-3 List of Prohibited Practices]

- Academic Version
    Universal human rights are the minimum standards that take precedence over any culture or religion. Acts that violate the "List of Prohibited Practices" stipulated in the THP-3 People's Charter are not permitted, even with cultural or religious justification.

- Explanatory Version
    Universal human rights are "the minimum rules that must be absolutely protected in any culture or religion in the world." Even the customs of a people or religion cannot violate human rights.

---

## Universal Crimes [See: THP-2 Preface, Article 2]

- Academic Version
    Universal crimes are acts that are subject to condemnation by all of humanity, and are limited to three types: large-scale civilian killing, institutional persecution, and repetition of aggression. Political issues are not subject to this.

- Explanatory Version
    Universal crimes are "absolutely unforgivable mortal sins." Examples are killing a large number of civilians, persecuting people as an institution, and repeating aggression. Only these three.

---

## Atonement / Reintegration [See: THP-2 Article 3]

- Academic Version
    Atonement is the official process by which a subject who has committed a sin returns to the inside of the "protective wall of humanity" with the fulfillment of responsibility and a pledge of non-recurrence.

- Explanatory Version
    Atonement is "saying you're sorry, promising not to do it again, and returning to everyone's company."

---

## Condemnation / Irreversible Mark [See: THP-2 Article 4]

- Academic Version
    Condemnation is an irreversible historical stigma handed down without room for salvation to a subject who has committed a universal mortal sin. The concept has some overlap with war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression, which are covered by existing international law (e.g., the Geneva Conventions, the Rome Statute [International Criminal Court]). However, condemnation in THP is unique in that it is not limited to judicial judgment, but is positioned as an "ethical declaration in the name of humanity."

- Explanatory Version
    Condemnation is "being eternally engraved in history as an unforgivable sin." For example, it is similar to "war crimes" and "crimes against humanity" judged by the Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute in international law, but THP is different in that it "declares it in the name of all humanity."

---

## Councils of Ethics [See: THP-2 Humanity Organization]

- Academic Version
    The Council of Ethics has a three-tiered structure: (1) the Global Council of Ethics (final right of declaration), (2) National Councils of Ethics (investigation and sentencing), and (3) the Humanity Study Group (advisory reconsideration and request for pardon).

- Explanatory Version
    The Council of Ethics is "three teams." The world's top (Global Council of Ethics), each country's investigators (National Councils of Ethics), and an advisory body that can speak for extenuating circumstances (Humanity Study Group).

---

## Humanity Study Group [See: THP-2 Special Note]

- Academic Version
    The Humanity Study Group is an advisory body with the Four Sages as provisional members, and has only the right to request pardon and the right to reconsider condemnation. There is no hierarchical relationship, and it is premised on democratic restructuring in the future.

- Explanatory Version
    The Humanity Study Group is "the representative of the conscience of humanity." For now, it is composed of four provisional members, and can only say "please forgive them" or "please think about it again." It has no great authority and is scheduled to be properly re-elected later.

---

## E-MAD (Economic Mutually Assured Deterrence) [See: THP-2 Article 5 / THP-2-S0]

- Academic Version
    E-MAD is a mechanism for automatically executing sanctions against subjects who violate the Ethics Charter by economic means. The details of the MAD score calculation formula are left to THP-2-S0, and implementation by Node.js is in progress.

- Explanatory Version
    E-MAD is "a mechanism for automatically imposing economic penalties if you break the rules." The detailed calculation method is still under development in a separate file.

---

## Ops-KPI Dashboard [See: THP-7]

- Academic Version
    A monitoring and measurement platform for THP operations. In addition to the normal dashboards for Gates A-C, there is also a "back-end dashboard" for Gate-D and beyond, assuming a transition to the Aftermath.

- Explanatory Version
    The Ops-KPI dashboard is "a screen to check if THP is running properly." There is a normal version (Gates A-C) and a secret version for emergencies (Gate-D~).

---

## Walpurgis [See: THP as a whole]

- Academic Version
    Walpurgis is a synonym for the collapse of order, starting with the $1.6 trillion failure risk in the US Treasury primary market scheduled for September 30, 2025. It is the starting point for the entire THP.

- Explanatory Version
    Walpurgis is the name of "a major incident that could destroy the world on September 30, 2025." THP started from there.

---

## Social Narrative [See: Ops-KPI Auxiliary Indicators]

- Academic Version
    A social narrative refers to the impact of popular stories and political slogans on the perception of order. It is a monitoring target as an auxiliary indicator for Ops-KPI.

- Explanatory Version
    A social narrative is "a story or slogan that everyone believes in." We check it because it moves society.

---

## Household Finance Narrative [See: Ops-KPI Auxiliary Indicators]

- Academic Version
    The household finance narrative is a fallacious discourse that equates national finance with a household budget. It is classified as an Ops-KPI auxiliary indicator because it can trigger market panic and irrational political decisions.

- Explanatory Version
    The household finance narrative is "the misunderstanding of thinking of the country's money as the same as a household budget." It is necessary to be careful because this can cause confusion in politics and the market.
