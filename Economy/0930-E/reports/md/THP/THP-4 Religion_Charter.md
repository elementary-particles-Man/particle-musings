# THP-4: Religion Charter

### Preface: Coexistence of Religion and Reality

#### Academic Version

The Horizon Protocol (THP) redefines religion as something that belongs to the realm of individual inner spirituality, completely separate from the state and politics. The basis for coexistence is to position **"reality,"** which is empirical and verifiable, as a common frame of reference above all religions and ideologies. Religion has the freedom to speak of hope and meaning in its respective doctrines on the foundation of this common reality.

#### Simplified Version

Respect each other's faith. However, no faith shall deny scientific or medical facts or justify acts that harm the life or health of others.

### Article 1: Freedom of Belief and Separation of Religion and State

- (See) Lexicon: Cult / Inviolability of Science and Medicine.

#### Academic Version

All individuals have the right to freely choose, seek, practice, or abandon their own beliefs. The state shall not favor or suppress any particular religion and has a duty to maintain a thorough separation of religion and state in public education and administration.

#### Simplified Version

1. It is completely up to the individual what religion to believe in or not to believe in.

2. The state and government shall not favor or bully any particular religion.

### Article 2: Duty of Mutual Respect

- (See) Lexicon: Cult / Inviolability of Science and Medicine.

#### Academic Version

All believers have a duty to respect the beliefs and ideas of others. The act of asserting the absoluteness of one's own doctrine and insulting or attacking the beliefs of others as "wrong" or "evil" is considered "intolerance" prohibited by THP and an act that destroys the spiritual peace of the world.

#### Simplified Version

3. You shall not make fun of or decide that other people's beliefs are wrong.

### Article 3: Prohibition of Falsehoods Against Reality

- (See) Lexicon: Cult / Inviolability of Science and Medicine.

#### Academic Version

Acts that deny scientific or medical reality in the name of religion, and acts that force them on others, are not faith but "falsehoods" and are prohibited¹.

#### Simplified Version

4. You shall not tell "lies" that deny science or medicine for religious reasons, or force them on others.

### Article 4: Definition and Exclusion of Cults

- (See) Lexicon: Cult / Inviolability of Science and Medicine.

#### Academic Version

Organizations that deny the beliefs of others, encourage isolation from society, or spiritually or economically exploit their followers are defined not as religions but as "cults" and are subject to exclusion based on the THP Ethics Charter.

#### Simplified Version

5. A dangerous group that deceives people to take their money or isolates them from society is not a religion but just a "cult." It is not allowed.

### Article 5: Salvation by Reality

- (See) Lexicon: Cult / Inviolability of Science and Medicine.

#### Academic Version

In the worldview of THP, "reality" already provides universal and neutral salvation through all things in nature. Religion plays the role of speaking of individual hopes and meanings on the foundation of that reality.

#### Simplified Version

6. "Reality," such as water, the sun, and the earth, allows all people to live equally. Religion is built on that gratitude.
