     DR-WALPURGIS-SOC-ETH (Rev-E): An analysis report on social and ethical shocks after DDC
    </h1>
    <h2 id="i">
     I. Executive Summary
    </h2>
    <p>
     This report analyzes mechanisms, size, and regional differences in the chain of systemic social and ethical shocks caused by the US Treasury market (DDC). This analysis assumes the quantitative framework of the preceding B1 (financial and political) and B2 (resources) reports.
    </p>
    <p>
     DDCs are not merely financial crisis, but rather the rapid and structural collapse of national capabilities in developed countries. The main route of its transmission is the simultaneous destruction of private assets and national revenue, which drives a self-reinforcement cycle of austerity, mass unemployment and social unrest. The current institutional framework is fatally underprepared for this type of complex shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Key forecasts (medium-term scenario)
     </strong>
     The baseline for this report, "L2: Catastrophic Scenario," predicts the following situations: Global financial assets losses reach $12 trillion to $21.6 trillion, which will seriously damage the real economy. Global U6 equivalent unemployment rates rise by $10-15$ percentage points (pp) from baseline, comparable to the Great Depression. This will result in 50-80 million international and domestic migration (immigrants and refugees) over the first six months. Violent crimes and property offences increased by $30-50% year-on-year in developed countries, resulting in significant deterioration in social order.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Major Regional Vulnerabilities
     </strong>
     The impact of shocks varies greatly from region to region.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        North America and Europe
       </strong>
       : It is the epicenter of the financial system, and the collapse of the labor market and deterioration of social cohesion are the most serious issues. In the EU, the governing dilemmas of fiscal discipline (stable and growth agreements) and response to social unrest threaten the survival of the Union itself.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Sub-Saharan Africa
       </strong>
       : Loss of food and energy import capacity will lead to massive famines and national collapse, creating unprecedented immigration pressure on Europe.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        East Asia
       </strong>
       : The main risks include a chain of bankruptcy in the manufacturing industry due to evaporation of export demand and a cutting-off of supply chains for important supplies.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Strategic Implications
     </strong>
     This analysis highlights three serious strategic challenges: First, there is a very high risk that many countries, including democratic states, will invoke emergency powers to maintain domestic order and will move towards authoritarian governance. Second, although it is theoretically possible to distribute essential resources for survival, such as food and medicine, it faces serious operational difficulties due to the decline in national capabilities and the expansion of the black market. Third, information environments where disinformation and incitement are prevalent will accelerate social division and significantly lower the psychological threshold for violent behavior. The post-DDC world will be an era in which not only financial order, but liberal democracy and the social contract itself will be fundamentally reexamined.

     II. Mechanism Map: The Mechanics of Social Collapse
    </h2>
    <p>
     How will the financial shock of DDC lead to the collapse of social structures? The causal chain is characterized by multiple self-enhancing feedback loops. This section dissects its propagation mechanism over time and presents the logical basis for subsequent analysis.
    </p>
    <h3 id="21-初期伝播t030日金融崩壊実体経済大変動">
     2.1. Propagation of initial shocks (T+0 to 30 days): From financial collapse to cataclysmic economic upheaval
    </h3>
    <p>
     The ignition point for the DDC is a technical failure of US Treasury bids, as defined in the B1/B2 report. This means the disappearance of global "risk-free assets" and instantly leads to a reassessment of global risk. The estimated losses for financial assets in the L2 (catastrophic) scenario are
    </p>
    <p>
     It reaches $12 trillion to $21.6 trillion. Asset destruction of this scale spreads immediately into the real economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Its main transmission path is the "asset effect feedback loop." The US financial assets to GDP ratio is about six times higher, and the evaporation of wealth on such a scale will crush the confidence of consumers and businesses, causing a sudden halt of spending and investment.
    </p>
    <p>
     This early shock is amplified by the very regulatory framework that was built after the 2008 financial crisis. In particular, complementary leverage ratios (SLRs) and margin requests by central clearing agencies (CCPs) have a procyclical nature that absorbs liquidity from the system as market volatility increases. This creates a self-enhancing and catastrophic "liquidity death spiral," which freezes the credit market and cuts the blood supply to the real economy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="22-悪循環t16月失業緊縮財政社会不安">
     2.2. 悪循環（T+1〜6ヶ月）：失業、緊縮財政、社会不安
    </h3>
    <p>
     The credit market freeze and evaporation of demand creates a wave of massive layoffs. Historically, the financial crisis first hits the credit-intensive construction and manufacturing industries, and then spreads to the services and public sectors. Given the scale of the DDC, this process is expected to be faster and more extensive than any previous crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
     The collapse of economic activity destroys the national tax revenue base. Under the DDC environment, new borrowing from international markets is not possible, and governments have no choice but to match their expenditures. This means that the nation will force forced superausterity to the nation at the very moment when social security demand is maximized.
    </p>
    <p>
     This situation serves as a powerful accelerator that destabilizes society. Ponticelli and Voth (2020) studies show that there is a statistically significant and strong positive correlation between the scale of government spending reductions and the frequency of social unrest (riots, demonstrations, general strikes, etc.). According to their baseline model, a 1 percentage point spending reduction in GDP ratio increases the log expectation for social anxiety events by 0.049. Under the DDC scenario, spending cuts of more than 5% of GDP will be inevitable in many countries, and the frequency of social unrest can increase nonlinearly, potentially more than twice the baseline.
    </p>
    <p>
     This social unrest further hinders economic activity and increases public safety maintenance costs. This creates a catastrophic feedback loop that forces governments to cut further expenditures, which leads to further unrest. This is the core mechanism in which financial shocks directly lead to degradation of social cohesion (analysis area D).
    </p>

     2.3. Systemic collapse (T+6 to 24 months): Mechanics surrounding national dysfunction and survival
    </h3>
    <p>
     Once the aforementioned vicious cycle exceeds the critical point, the state begins to lose its ability to carry out basic functions (preservation of public order, infrastructure management, and social security). At this stage, the government will resort to more authoritative measures to maintain the legitimacy of its governance. In other words, the activating emergency authority (analysis area B) and the introduction of a system for distribution of resources essential for survival (analysis area C).
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, the loss of the security and opportunities offered by the nation will begin to seek survival on its own. This triggers the large-scale cross-border migrant and refugee outbreak (Analysis Area A). In the country, black markets and underground economies that are not governed by the state will expand, further eroding tax revenue bases and national legitimacy. At this stage, the crisis completely transforms from an economic to a political and social aspect that questions the very existence of the nation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="iii-分岐封込不況長期化危機崩壊">
     III. Scenario fork: Contained recessions, prolonged crises, systemic collapse
    </h2>
    <p>
     The consequences of post-DDC society do not follow a single path. The severity diverges greatly depending on the speed, consistency and political feasibility of early policy responses. This section presents three different scenarios based on the L1/L2/L3 framework of the B1/B2 report.
    </p>
    <h3 id="31-定義分岐条件">
     3.1. Definition of a scenario and branching conditions

    <ul>
     <li>

         </strong>
         : After the DDC occurs, policy coordination on an overwhelming scale will be realized, extremely quickly (within T+72 hours) and unpopularly constrained. Specifically, it includes the Fed's immediate exemption of SLRs, the G7 central bank's launch of unlimited dollar swaplines, and the coordinated implementation of large-scale quantitative easing (QE).

         <strong>
          probability

         : Considering the political dysfunction detailed in the B1 report (attack on the Fed's independence, fiscal brink policy), the probability of realising this scenario is extremely low.
        </p>

        <p>
         <strong>
          Branching conditions
         </strong>
         : Policy responses are delayed and political conflicts limit the scale of the system. The Fed is hesitant to act and insufficient measures are taken after the SLR/CCP amplification mechanisms have caused serious damage to the real economy. While a complete meltdown in the financial system is avoided, the economy is plunged into a severe and long-term recession.

The financial crisis will shift to a crisis of national trust, and international cooperation will completely collapse (e.g., weaponizing the dollar swap line). Furthermore, exogenous shocks such as power grid failures overlap, causing core infrastructure such as payment systems and supply chains to become physically malfunctional.

     Note: Unemployment estimates adjusted cases of the 2008 financial crisis ($4.7$pp in the US) and the Great Depression (25% peaking in the US) at a more severe shock scale for the DDC. The immigration and refugee flow extrapolated the Syrian crisis (a pace of over 2 million people a year) as a global crisis. Increased crime rates referenced research into unemployment-crime correlations and cases of the Argentine crisis.

         : The de la Rua administration issued a state of siege on December 19th, attempting to limit freedom of assembly. However, this further fueled the public's anger, and attempts to censor the media failed. The next day, the president escaped from the presidential office by helicopter, and the restoration of order by authority completely failed.

          U.K.
         </strong>
         : Since 1940, a sophisticated system has been introduced that combines distribution notebooks and point systems for food, clothing, fuel, etc. Supported by the government's high administrative capabilities, effective public relations through the BBC, and the social unity of "all-in-the-people unity," the system functioned fairly and effectively. As a result, it is said that the nutritional status of the people has improved since before the war. Although there was a black market, it was not on a scale that covered society as a whole.

        <p>
         <strong>
          Cuba
         </strong>
         : The economy collapsed during the "special period" after the collapse of the Soviet Union (early 1990s), and the existing libreta system faced an absolute shortage of supplies. The amount and amount distributed has decreased dramatically, making it completely insufficient to support the survival of the people. This created a serious disparity between the dollar-bearing and the have-nots, with the black market being the de facto main source. The distribution system became a formal system that was not just fair distribution, but merely managed shortages.

         <strong>
          Corruption Resistance
         </strong>

         : Loss of trust in currency has led to distrust in the government and the entire existing social system. Conspiracy theories that sought "traitors" and "speculators" became widespread, fueling social division. Economic predicament has driven people from rational judgment to action based on anger and resentment.

          Threshold for violence
         </strong>
         Hyperinflation is not just an economic phenomenon, but a process that destroys the psychology of society. When hope for the future and trust in fair rules are lost, the psychological threshold for people to resort to the direct means of violence drops dramatically.

       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Implications for DDC
         </strong>
         : The collapse of US Treasury, which is "risk-free assets," is the destruction of the foundation of trust in the modern financial system, comparable to the collapse of currency in Weimar. This suggests that in a post-DDC world, irrational fear and anger are the main forces that drive society, and there is a high risk of creating an unpredictable cycle of violence. The role of radio (RTLM) in the Rwandan genocide should be referenced as an extreme example of how incitement of hatred can be easy and destructive in modern social media environments.

    </h2>
    <p>
     The analysis in this report is based on certain assumptions and contains multiple uncertainties. These factors can have a significant impact on the actual development of a crisis.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Price, supply, and unemployment resilience
       </strong>
       : This analysis assumes that elasticity between economic variables in past crises (e.g., unemployment response to demand shock) works similarly after DDC. However, because DDC is an unprecedented scale of structural disruption, these relationships can change nonlinearly, causing unemployment and shortages to worsen at a rate that exceeds expectations. In particular, the disruption of the global supply chain will fundamentally transform the relationship between price and supply.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The impact of policy delays
       </strong>
       : As the scenario branch shows, the consequences of this report are extremely sensitive to the timing of policy responses. The analysis assumes delays of weeks to months due to political paralysis, but if this delay is further prolonged, even moderate scenarios (L2) can easily move towards catastrophic scenarios (L3). The time lag from policy decision to implementation is one of the most important variables that determine the severity of a crisis.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The impact of missing data
       </strong>
       : As the crisis gets worse, the national capacity for collecting statistics will decline significantly. Even basic data such as unemployment, crime rates, and immigration flows can be less reliable and delayed or halted reporting. This will undermine the effectiveness of the early warning dashboard, inaccurate situational awareness, and risk policy decisions being "flying in the dark." Quantitative predictors of the analysis should be interpreted with broader confidence intervals, assuming this degradation of the data environment.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Social psychology and irrationality of behavior
       </strong>
       : This analysis assumes to some extent people's rational responses to economic incentives. However, as the Weimar case shows, under extreme stress, irrational elements such as fear, anger and conspiracy theories can govern people's actions. The amplification of information through social media makes this irrationality even stronger in modern times. The "tipping point" of society (a turning point where violence becomes a norm) is unpredictable by pure economic models and is the biggest uncertainty factor in this report.
