			What is Walpurgis?
		</h2>
<p>
			In a narrow sense, this refers to the failure to hold a primary bid for US Treasury on September 30th (the end of the US fiscal year).

Unlike Japan, where the Bank of Japan is a breakwater, the United States does not have any institutional support, and the collapse of trust in US bonds directly leads to the "death of the dollar."
