      <p>This series, <em>The Walpurgis Papers</em>, has dissected the unavoidable structural collapse of September 30, 2025—from its financial ignition point to its cascading impacts across society, resources, politics, and ethics.<br />
      What stands here is not merely a prediction or a warning. It is a record that pursues a deeper question: <strong>not “what will break,” but “why it breaks, and how we survive once it has broken.”</strong></p>
      <hr />
      <h2>1. The Meaning of Walpurgis</h2>
      <p>“Walpurgis” is not a single crisis. It is the moment when the flaws of entire systems reach their extreme and burn through every circuit of the global order at once.<br />
      The failed Treasury auction is only the symbol.<br />
      The chain rupture of resources, the retreat of democracy, the collapse of emerging economies, and even the implosion of the United States itself—<br />
      these are not separate events, but amplifiers converging into one <strong>civilizational crisis</strong>.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>2. Connection to THP</h2>
      <p>The conclusion is clear.<br />
      <strong>The old order has no safety valve.</strong><br />
      Survival beyond Walpurgis depends on whether we can shift to a pre-designed order that is <strong>transparent and automatic</strong>.<br />
      The Horizon Protocol (THP) is that survival framework.</p>
      <p>Finance must be rendered transparent as public infrastructure.<br />
      Resources must be secured through the Lifeline Plan.<br />
      Ethics must be upheld through the irrevocable condemnation of universal crimes.<br />
      The <em>Walpurgis Papers</em> serve as a <strong>diagnostic certificate</strong> validating the necessity and inevitability of THP.</p>
      <hr />
      <h2>3. A Record for Posterity</h2>
      <p>This series need not be complete.<br />
      It is not a finished scripture, but a <strong>foundational stone for an evolving protocol</strong>—to be reread, revised, and expanded by future generations.<br />
      Those who endure Walpurgis will carry its pain and chaos, yet with this record they speak to the future:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>“We were here. And we did not abandon this world.”</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr />
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Walpurgis is unavoidable. But it is not the end.<br />
      It is, rather, the proof of birth for a new order.<br />
      Amid collapse and confusion, choice remains:<br />
      <strong>to descend into a world ruled by fear and violence, or to build an order grounded in transparency and responsibility.</strong></p>
      <p><em>The Walpurgis Papers</em> stand as the final torch that demands this choice.<br />
      From here, actions will speak louder than words.<br />
      To those who preserve order, salvation.<br />
      To those who destroy it, condemnation.<br />
      This simple yet absolute principle is the only path forward.</p>
