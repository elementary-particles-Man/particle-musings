      <h2>A. Core Financial Terms</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Primary Dealers (PDs)</strong>
        Large financial institutions authorized to purchase newly issued U.S. Treasury securities directly from the Treasury. The “distributors” in the auction system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Primary Market</strong>
        The market where the government sells new securities to PDs. Analogous to a “premiere screening.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Secondary Market</strong>
        The market where previously issued securities are traded among all investors. Analogous to a “public theater.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Auction Tail</strong>
        The gap between expected yields (when-issued pricing) and the actual auction yield. A large tail signals weak demand and collapsing confidence.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Bid-to-Cover Ratio (B/C)</strong>
        Total bids received divided by the amount offered. Below 2.0 indicates insufficient demand.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Repo Market</strong>
        The short-term funding market where Treasuries and other assets are pledged as collateral. When it freezes, the entire financial system seizes up.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)</strong>
        The key benchmark for U.S. repo funding. A sharp spike indicates acute liquidity stress.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>CCP (Central Counterparty) &amp; Margin Calls</strong>
        Clearinghouses that stand between buyers and sellers. In crises they demand more collateral, draining cash at the worst possible time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Liquidity vs. Solvency</strong>
        Liquidity is the ability to obtain cash immediately; solvency is having assets greater than liabilities. Walpurgis begins as a liquidity seizure but evolves into a solvency crisis.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>B. Sovereign Finance &amp; Institutions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Household Budget Fallacy</strong>
        The false belief that governments must manage finances like households. It underpins the Walpurgis dynamic.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Fiscal Dominance</strong>
        A condition where central banks are forced into directly financing government deficits. Exemplified by China’s “financial winter.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Taxes (Drain Function)</strong>
        Not a source of government funding, but a “drain” to withdraw money from circulation and control inflation — a thermostat for economic temperature.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Eurozone Doom Loop</strong>
        A destructive cycle where banks hold large volumes of domestic sovereign bonds; falling bond prices erode bank capital, governments cannot credibly backstop them, and the loop intensifies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>TARGET2</strong>
        The Eurozone’s internal payments system. Rapidly widening balances are a signal of capital flight.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>BRRD (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive)</strong>
        EU directive mandating “bail-in”: at least 8% of a bank’s liabilities must be written down before public funds can be used.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>TPI (Transmission Protection Instrument)</strong>
        The ECB’s discretionary bond-buying tool to counter disorderly market dynamics. Its use is political and not guaranteed.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>C. Global Crisis Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Walpurgis</strong>
        The codename for the multi-layered global crisis triggered by the failed U.S. Treasury auction on September 30, 2025.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Dollar Default Crisis (DDC)</strong>
        A systemic breakdown of the Treasury market — functionally a default of the U.S. dollar as the global risk-free asset.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Contagion Channels</strong>
        The four vectors of DDC spread: (1) direct sovereign reserve losses, (2) currency chaos, (3) global dollar shortage, (4) stock market collapse.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Emerging Market Default Wave</strong>
        A cascade of sovereign defaults across emerging markets due to dollar famine.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Resource Shock</strong>
        A large-scale disruption in energy, food, or materials that cascades across societies. Scarcity in one domain multiplies scarcity in others.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>E-MAD (Economic Mutual Assured Destruction)</strong>
        A global equilibrium premised on rational actors avoiding self-destruction. Collapses when coercive nuclear rhetoric undermines trust.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>D. China-Specific Terms</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>LGFV (Local Government Financing Vehicle)</strong>
        Off-balance-sheet borrowing entities used by Chinese local governments. Total liabilities estimated at \~57 trillion CNY.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Depeg / One-off Devaluation</strong>
        A forced abandonment of the managed exchange rate, leading to a sharp RMB depreciation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Scissor Crisis (Energy)</strong>
        The dual squeeze of falling hard-currency inflows and depleting strategic reserves, leading to energy shortages.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Industrial Credit Collapse</strong>
        When quality and disclosure failures in flagship sectors (e.g., EVs, machinery) spill over into sovereign credit risk.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>E. U.S.-Specific Terms</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Municipal Bond Stack</strong>
        The \~\$4.2 trillion U.S. state and local government debt market. Critically lacks a permanent lender of last resort.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>VRDO (Variable Rate Demand Obligation)</strong>
        A type of municipal bond with resettable rates. Failure to roll these obligations signals imminent liquidity crisis.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Double Pledge Fraud</strong>
        The illegal reuse of collateral for multiple loans. Exposed in the September 2025 Tricolor bankruptcy.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>F. Social &amp; Ethical Dimensions</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Mass Unemployment &amp; Migration</strong>
        Tens of millions of job losses and refugee flows projected in the aftermath of DDC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Authoritarian Opportunism</strong>
        The tendency of regimes to use crises to consolidate power and erode civil liberties.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Ethics of Survival</strong>
        The moral battlefield over who receives scarce essentials such as food, medicine, and energy. Under THP, governed by the principle of condemning universal crimes.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h2>G. Illustrative Analogies (for Readers)</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Wallet vs. Faucet</strong>
        A household wallet is a bucket that empties unless refilled. The government’s wallet is the faucet itself — it issues currency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Premiere vs. Theater</strong>
        Primary market = the “premiere screening.” Secondary market = the “public theater.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Guardian Angel</strong>
        The Bank of Japan’s unconditional bond backstop — a support absent in the U.S. system.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
