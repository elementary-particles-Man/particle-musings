## A. Core Financial Terms

* **Primary Dealers (PDs)**
  Large financial institutions authorized to purchase newly issued U.S. Treasury securities directly from the Treasury. The ‚Äúdistributors‚Äù in the auction system.

* **Primary Market**
  The market where the government sells new securities to PDs. Analogous to a ‚Äúpremiere screening.‚Äù

* **Secondary Market**
  The market where previously issued securities are traded among all investors. Analogous to a ‚Äúpublic theater.‚Äù

* **Auction Tail**
  The gap between expected yields (when-issued pricing) and the actual auction yield. A large tail signals weak demand and collapsing confidence.

* **Bid-to-Cover Ratio (B/C)**
  Total bids received divided by the amount offered. Below 2.0 indicates insufficient demand.

* **Repo Market**
  The short-term funding market where Treasuries and other assets are pledged as collateral. When it freezes, the entire financial system seizes up.

* **SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)**
  The key benchmark for U.S. repo funding. A sharp spike indicates acute liquidity stress.

* **CCP (Central Counterparty) & Margin Calls**
  Clearinghouses that stand between buyers and sellers. In crises they demand more collateral, draining cash at the worst possible time.

* **Liquidity vs. Solvency**
  Liquidity is the ability to obtain cash immediately; solvency is having assets greater than liabilities. Walpurgis begins as a liquidity seizure but evolves into a solvency crisis.

## B. Sovereign Finance & Institutions

* **Household Budget Fallacy**
  The false belief that governments must manage finances like households. It underpins the Walpurgis dynamic.

* **Fiscal Dominance**
  A condition where central banks are forced into directly financing government deficits. Exemplified by China‚Äôs ‚Äúfinancial winter.‚Äù

* **Taxes (Drain Function)**
  Not a source of government funding, but a ‚Äúdrain‚Äù to withdraw money from circulation and control inflation ‚Äî a thermostat for economic temperature.

* **Eurozone Doom Loop**
  A destructive cycle where banks hold large volumes of domestic sovereign bonds; falling bond prices erode bank capital, governments cannot credibly backstop them, and the loop intensifies.

* **TARGET2**
  The Eurozone‚Äôs internal payments system. Rapidly widening balances are a signal of capital flight.

* **BRRD (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive)**
  EU directive mandating ‚Äúbail-in‚Äù: at least 8% of a bank‚Äôs liabilities must be written down before public funds can be used.

* **TPI (Transmission Protection Instrument)**
  The ECB‚Äôs discretionary bond-buying tool to counter disorderly market dynamics. Its use is political and not guaranteed.

## C. Global Crisis Concepts

* **Walpurgis**
  The codename for the multi-layered global crisis triggered by the failed U.S. Treasury auction on September 30, 2025.

* **Dollar Default Crisis (DDC)**
  A systemic breakdown of the Treasury market ‚Äî functionally a default of the U.S. dollar as the global risk-free asset.

* **Contagion Channels**
  The four vectors of DDC spread: (1) direct sovereign reserve losses, (2) currency chaos, (3) global dollar shortage, (4) stock market collapse.

* **Emerging Market Default Wave**
  A cascade of sovereign defaults across emerging markets due to dollar famine.

* **Resource Shock**
  A large-scale disruption in energy, food, or materials that cascades across societies. Scarcity in one domain multiplies scarcity in others.

* **E-MAD (Economic Mutual Assured Destruction)**
  A global equilibrium premised on rational actors avoiding self-destruction. Collapses when coercive nuclear rhetoric undermines trust.

## D. China-Specific Terms

* **LGFV (Local Government Financing Vehicle)**
  Off-balance-sheet borrowing entities used by Chinese local governments. Total liabilities estimated at \~57 trillion CNY.

* **Depeg / One-off Devaluation**
  A forced abandonment of the managed exchange rate, leading to a sharp RMB depreciation.

* **Scissor Crisis (Energy)**
  The dual squeeze of falling hard-currency inflows and depleting strategic reserves, leading to energy shortages.

* **Industrial Credit Collapse**
  When quality and disclosure failures in flagship sectors (e.g., EVs, machinery) spill over into sovereign credit risk.

---

## E. U.S.-Specific Terms

* **Municipal Bond Stack**
  The \~\$4.2 trillion U.S. state and local government debt market. Critically lacks a permanent lender of last resort.

* **VRDO (Variable Rate Demand Obligation)**
  A type of municipal bond with resettable rates. Failure to roll these obligations signals imminent liquidity crisis.

* **Double Pledge Fraud**
  The illegal reuse of collateral for multiple loans. Exposed in the September 2025 Tricolor bankruptcy.

## F. Social & Ethical Dimensions

* **Mass Unemployment & Migration**
  Tens of millions of job losses and refugee flows projected in the aftermath of DDC.

* **Authoritarian Opportunism**
  The tendency of regimes to use crises to consolidate power and erode civil liberties.

* **Ethics of Survival**
  The moral battlefield over who receives scarce essentials such as food, medicine, and energy. Under THP, governed by the principle of condemning universal crimes.

## G. Illustrative Analogies (for Readers)

* **Wallet vs. Faucet**
  A household wallet is a bucket that empties unless refilled. The government‚Äôs wallet is the faucet itself ‚Äî it issues currency.

* **Premiere vs. Theater**
  Primary market = the ‚Äúpremiere screening.‚Äù Secondary market = the ‚Äúpublic theater.‚Äù

* **Guardian Angel**
  The Bank of Japan‚Äôs unconditional bond backstop ‚Äî a support absent in the U.S. system.
