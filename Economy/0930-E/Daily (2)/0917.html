<h2>[Most important notes] Concerns about bankruptcy and credit contraction have become reality for US and China-sized regional banks</h2>
<p>
                Today, it was reported that Alliance Western Bank (fictitious)**, a mid-sized US regional bank, is in a serious business crisis, citing an increase in losses related to commercial real estate (CRE) loans and subprime car loans. This caused the bank's stock price to crash more than 70%, and trading was suspended.
            </p>
<p>
                This is the very situation we have warned about in the Domino Scenario. This is conclusive evidence that the single-company credit event, the collapse of Tricolor, has finally been transmitted to the main body of the US financial system, particularly the vulnerable local banking sector.
            </p>
<p>
                Following this report, the credit market has completely frozen. The high yield bond spread (HY OAS) showed an abnormal increase of +85bp from the previous day, marking the highest increase since the Lehman shock. The market is no longer taking into account the risks of the entire system, rather than the individual company risks.
            </p>

<h2>Market Overview and Analysis</h2>
<h3>From "bad yen appreciation" to "yen appreciation under credit contraction"</h3>
<p>
                After the intense volatility yesterday, today's market has begun to collapse with a clear direction.
            </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A full-scale escape to quality:</strong> The dollar/yen again turned towards a stronger yen, falling to the 145 yen range. This is a full-scale "escape to quality" that agitates against the clear credit risk of concerns about US regional banks going bankrupt. With gold prices continuing to rise, there is no doubt that capital outflows from the base currency, dollar, are accelerating.
                </li>
<li>
<strong>Surge in the Fear Index and Evaporation of Liquidity:</strong> The VIX index has reached 28 units, where the risky waters are considered, and the bond version of the MOVE index has reached 130 units, which is the warning waters. This means that market participants are withdrawing from the transaction itself, extremely afraid of further price fluctuations in the future. Liquidity is beginning to disappear from the market.
                </li>
<li>
<strong>Signs of a deflationary spiral:</strong> The decline in WTI crude oil prices is extremely important. Concerns that financial market turmoil will destroy demand for the real economy (recession concerns) have led to a fall in crude oil prices. This is an early sign that financial contractions cause a deflationary spiral.
                </li>
</ul>

<h2>Strategic evaluation from THP</h2>
<p>
                **The situation has reached "Gate-A (Note)" in the "Snowball Monitoring System." **
            </p>
<p>
                The MOVE index is above 130, and HY OAS is expanding at a pace well above +150bp per week. This means moving into the "caution" stage of the protocol, but the reality is much more serious. A concrete event, which was the collapse of the regional bank, occurred earlier than the sequences we had envisioned (T-13 to T-10).
            </p>
<p>
                The snowballs are now becoming huge at a speed that everyone can see. The next focus will be the US Treasury short-term bond bids that will take place this weekend and the growing concerns of chain failure to other local banks.
            </p>
<p>
                War-Room will now officially recognize the **surveillance level as "Gate-A"** and will upgrade the THP-7 status from WATCH(üü°) to **ALERT(üî∂)**. All parties must follow the protocol and begin preparing for the next phase.
