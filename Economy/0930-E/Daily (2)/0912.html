		The numbers are either preliminary or unconfirmed, so they will be replaced with confirmed values ​​at a later date.

<p>
		Walpurgis's perspective: While the dollar/yen moves to 148 yen, the rise in long-term interest rates and the end-of-month issue/redemption calendar tightens cash flow. The failure to hold (confirmed) of the US Treasury primary on September 30 suggests a distortion in supply and demand, and attention is paid to modulation in the short-term capital market.

<section class="conclusion">
<h2>
		所見
		</h2>
<p>
		There is a mismatch between strengthening stock momentum and rising funding costs. From the Walpurgis perspective, the more AI-led rises, the more likely it is to surface the vulnerability of government bond supply and demand and liquidity. Assuming that the primary will not be held on September 30th, we are wary of the spread of report interest rates and worsening bidding indicators.
