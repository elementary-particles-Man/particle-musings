		<h2>
		1. Purpose and Basic Philosophy
		</h2>
		<p>
		THP (The Horizon Protocol) is an implementation framework to protect
		<strong>
			market stability
		</strong>
		,
		<strong>
			preserve life
		</strong>
		, and
		<strong>
			respect humanity and ethnic order
		</strong>
		as one under the chain shock including "Walpurgis" on September 30, 2025, to break away from the conventional hegemonic currency dependence and shift to a
		<strong>
			peace utility layer
		</strong>
		.
		</p>
		<div class="creed-box">
		<h3>
			Basic Philosophy of THP
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Creed:
			</strong>
			Win-Win / Transparency / Non-Hegemony
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Frame (Code of Conduct):
			</strong>
			"Do not kill, do not steal, accept self-destruction, and offer order"
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Charters:
			</strong>
			Ethics / Religion / People / World / Ops-KPI / Lexicon (Institutionalized Public Charters)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			It is not just a market bailout, but by simultaneously stabilizing
			<strong>
			society, culture, and institutions
			</strong>
			, it deters the recurrence of crises.

		<h2>
		2. Design (Layer Configuration)
		</h2>
		<p>
		THP is designed with five layers:
		<strong>
			Pipes × Assets × Supply × Life × Charter
		</strong>
		.
		</p>
		<h3>
		2.1 Financial Pipes
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Safety Net
			</span>
			Automation and constant operation of major currency swaps (Japan, India, Europe, Gulf).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Highway
			</span>
			Standard implementation of multi-currency routes (mBridge, etc.) that can be settled without going through the dollar.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Peace Utility
			</span>
			Priority settlement lane for humanitarian, medical, food, and power (interruption tolerance).
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
		2.2 Value Backing (Assets)
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			SoftGold (JIS/CH certified):
			</strong>
			Based on audited precious metals, credibility is secured with
			<em>
			integrated evidence
			</em>
			.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Complementary Basket:
			</strong>
			A combination of real-demand resources such as Pt/Cu/Li absorbs currency fluctuations.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
		2.3 Supply Chain
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			OSAT Redundancy:
			</strong>
			Back-end process distribution to India and Southeast Asia (target of 48-hour switching).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Jurisdictional Firewall:
			</strong>
			Build tamper resistance through audits and dual ledgers in Malaysia, etc.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
		2.4 Life Infrastructure
		</h3>
		<div class="cols">
		<ul>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Water:
			</strong>
			Regional deployment and quality audits of desalination/atmospheric water harvesting.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Medical:
			</strong>
			Antimicrobial Stewardship (S) + 6-month stockpile of essential medicines + 90-day vaccine SLA.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Education:
			</strong>
			Free AI reskilling and basic education.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Food:
			</strong>
			Permanent establishment of alternative procurement networks and inventory dashboards for breadbaskets.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Power/Communications:
			</strong>
			Distributed power sources + phased restart runbook / securing minimum communications.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>
		2.5 Charter
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Public Charters:
			</strong>
			Make decision-making auditable by publishing ethics, religion, people, operational KPIs, lexicon, and world charters.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>
			Narrative Risk Management:
			</strong>
			KPI-ize misinformation and incitement and institutionalize countermeasures.
		</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>
		3. Phased Operation (Continuous Transition)
		</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Phase: Pre‑Walpurgis
			</span>
			Monitoring and warning (Ops‑KPI always active, visualization of SoftGold inventory, food, and power).
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Phase: Shock Absorption
			</span>
			Maintain humanitarian functions with automatic swap activation / Peace Utility priority lane.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Phase: Redefinition
			</span>
			Institutionalize the departure from dollar dependence with multi-currency settlement and a resource basket.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span class="badge">
			Phase: Global Charter
			</span>
			Permanent establishment of legalization, public audits, and educational curriculum for the charters.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="note-box">
		<p>
			<strong class="negative">
			Tier0 (DEATH) Response:
			</strong>
			If market functions are zeroed out due to physical infrastructure destruction, immediately switch to priceless operation (phased restart / safe-side evaluation / PR template).

		<h2>
		Special Note: The Peacekeeping System "E-MAD"
		</h2>
		<p>
		At the core of the THP concept is a completely new framework for war deterrence based on economic rationality called
		<strong>
			E-MAD (Economic Mutually Assured Destruction)
		</strong>
		.
		</p>
		<div class="note-box">
		<h3>
			The mechanism of E-MAD is extremely clear.
		</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Visualization of Economic Losses:
			</strong>
			<br/>
			If a country starts a war, the economic losses that the country itself and the entire world will suffer (GDP decline, trade suspension, collapse of asset values, etc.) will be calculated and published in real time based on a highly transparent formula.
			</li>
			<li>
			<strong>
				Presentation of Decision-Making to the People:
			</strong>
			<br/>
			The calculated specific loss amount is presented directly to the people, and the ultimate question is posed: "Do you support going to war, even if it means accepting this enormous loss?"
			</li>
		</ol>
		</div>
		<p>
		E-MAD is based not on ambiguous things like the political ambitions or ideologies of rulers, but on the extremely clear indicator of "the economic interests of each and every citizen." This deters war by "sharing losses" economically, instead of the conventional military "balance of terror."
		</p>
		<p>
		This system exposes the "true cost of war" hidden behind statistical figures and is the cornerstone of peace in THP, designed to encourage people to make wise decisions before it is too late.
		</p>

		<h2>
		4. Conclusion: From Defeat to a Peace Utility
		</h2>
		<p>
		THP is based on a design in which "there is no profit in fighting over things" in a crisis, and by having the United States and other countries share responsibility by leveraging their respective strengths, it provides
		<strong>
			order as a public good, not as hegemony
		</strong>
		. The purpose is simple—
				to protect
		<em>
			human life, livelihoods, and markets
		</em>
		in that order, and to push the world to a more
		<strong>
			moderate and verifiable
		</strong>
		phase.

		This is an overview. Detailed role allocation, contingency plans, and technical specifications will be described in Part 2 (Strategy).
