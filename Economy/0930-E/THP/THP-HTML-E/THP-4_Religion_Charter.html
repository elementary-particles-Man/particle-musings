		<h4 id="detailed-version">
		Detailed Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		The Horizon Protocol (THP) redefines religion as belonging to the realm of individual inner spirituality, completely separate from the state and politics. The basis for coexistence lies in positioning
		<strong>
			"reality,"
		</strong>
		which is empirical and verifiable, as a common frame of reference above all religions and ideologies. Religions have the freedom to speak of hope and meaning within their respective doctrines, based on this common reality.
		</p>
		<h4 id="simplified-version">
		Simplified Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		Respect each other's faith. However, no faith shall deny scientific or medical facts and justify actions that harm the life or health of others.

		<p>
		All individuals have the right to freely choose, explore, practice, or abandon their faith. The state shall not favor or suppress any particular religion and has an obligation to maintain a thorough separation of religion and state in public education and administration.
		</p>
		<h4 id="simplified-version-1">

			<p>
			What religion to believe in, or not to believe in, is entirely an individual's freedom.

			The state and government must not play favorites or bully any particular religion.

		<p>
		All believers have a duty to respect the beliefs and ideas of others. The act of asserting the absolute nature of one's own doctrine and insulting or attacking the beliefs of others as "wrong" or "evil" is "intolerance" prohibited by THP and is considered an act that destroys the spiritual peace of the world.

			<p>
			You must not make fun of other people's beliefs or decide that they are wrong.

		Acts that deny scientific and medical reality in the name of religion, and acts that force them on others, are not faith but "falsehoods" and are prohibited¹.

		<h4 id="simplified-version-3">

		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			You must not tell "lies" that deny science or medicine for religious reasons, or force them on others.

		Organizations that deny the beliefs of others, encourage isolation from society, or spiritually or economically exploit their followers are defined not as religions but as "cults" and are subject to exclusion under the THP Ethics Charter.
		</p>
		<h4 id="simplified-version-4">

		<ol>

			<p>
			Dangerous groups that deceive people to take their money or isolate them from society are not religions but just "cults." They are not allowed.

		<p>
		In the worldview of THP, "reality" already provides universal and neutral salvation through all things in nature. Religion plays the role of speaking of individual hopes and meanings on the foundation of that reality.
		</p>
		<h4 id="simplified-version-5">
		Simplified Version
		</h4>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			"Reality," such as water, the sun, and the earth, allows all people to live equally. Religion is built on gratitude for that.
