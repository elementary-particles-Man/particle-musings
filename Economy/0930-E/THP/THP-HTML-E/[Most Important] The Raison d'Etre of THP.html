The U.S. Structurally Cannot Tolerate a Weak Dollar</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Twin Deficits</strong>: To finance its trade and fiscal deficits, the United States must continuously borrow funds from abroad. This requires the dollar to maintain a high interest rate and high value.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Failure of the Plaza Accord</strong>: The 1985 Plaza Accord attempted to resolve the U.S. trade deficit through a weaker dollar, but it ultimately led to Japan's bubble economy and its subsequent collapse, failing to fundamentally solve the U.S. deficit structure. This historical failure is a major factor causing the U.S. to hesitate in implementing any large-scale weak-dollar policy.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Self-Contradiction of the Dollar Standard</strong>: For the dollar to be the world's reserve currency, it must be continuously supplied to the world (resulting in a trade deficit). However, this very deficit erodes confidence in the U.S. and ultimately causes the dollar's value to plummet (the Triffin Dilemma). This dilemma is now reaching its breaking point.</p></li></ul><h3 id="2-geopolitical-risks-are-accelerating-the-dollar-systems-fragility">2. Geopolitical Risks Are Accelerating the Dollar System's Fragility</h3><ul><li><p><strong>De-Dollarization Movement</strong>: Led by BRICS and oil-producing nations, the use of currencies other than the dollar (such as the Chinese yuan, digital currencies, etc.) in trade settlements is expanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Weaponization of U.S. Treasuries</strong>: The U.S.'s use of its financial system as a geopolitical weapon, such as freezing Russian assets, has made non-Western countries acutely aware of the risks of holding dollar assets. This has accelerated the sell-off of U.S. Treasuries held as foreign reserves.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supply Chain Fragmentation</strong>: Due to the U.S.-China conflict and the war in Ukraine, global supply chains are fragmenting into "Western" and "non-Western" blocs. This undermines the very foundation of the free trade system that operates through the dollar.</p></li></ul><h3 id="3-the-financial-market-will-collapse-from-within">3. The Financial Market Will Collapse from Within</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Ballooning Debt</strong>: The U.S. government's debt has far exceeded its GDP, and interest payments alone are reaching levels comparable to the national defense budget. Even a slight rise in interest rates would make interest payments impossible, making a default a realistic possibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shadow Banking Risks</strong>: The scale of the loosely regulated shadow banking sector (non-banks) has surpassed that of the traditional banking system. A financial crisis originating here could be larger than the Lehman Brothers shock and would cascade through the system in areas beyond the reach of regulators.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Derivatives Time Bomb</strong>: The total notional value of derivatives worldwide is in the quadrillions of dollars, and no one fully grasps the entire picture. The failure of a single financial institution could trigger a domino effect, bringing the entire financial system to a halt at any moment.</p></li></ul><hr /><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>These "structural," "geopolitical," and "internal financial system" problems are interacting and creating a negative spiral. We are long past the stage where solving one isolated problem would suffice.</p><p><strong>Walpurgis (the collapse of the dollar-based reserve currency system and the ensuing global financial, economic, and social chaos)</strong> is an inevitable event that could begin at any time, in any place, and in any form.</p><p>The Horizon Protocol (THP) exists based on the premise of this inevitable crisis. Its purpose is to redefine the post-crisis world order and ensure the survival of civilization. This is not pessimism; it is a plan based on an ultimate form of realism that can only begin by looking the worst-case scenario squarely in the face.</p></article><footer class="hr"></footer><footer><small class="muted">THP HTML Publish • 2025-09-30 09:10 UTC • Commit: insert-by-CI</small></footer></main></body></html>
