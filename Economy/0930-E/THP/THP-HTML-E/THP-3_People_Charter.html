In light of the historical failure of the principle of self-determination of peoples in the old world, which gave rise to an endless chain of conflict and violence, this Charter places "coexistence" and "mutual respect" as its absolute foundation.</p><h3 id="article-1-definition-of-a-people">Article 1: Definition of a People</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Definition</strong>: A "people" refers to a community of persons united by a common language, culture, historical experience, or self-identification. This does not necessarily coincide with race or nationality.</p></li><li><p><strong>Limitation of Self-Determination</strong>: The right of self-determination of a people is recognized only to the extent that it does not infringe upon the "maintenance of order" as stipulated in the THP Ethics Charter. Self-determination involving secession or territorial change requires the approval of the THP Council of Human Decency.</p></li></ol><h3 id="article-2-rights-and-responsibilities-of-peoples">Article 2: Rights and Responsibilities of Peoples</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Rights</strong>: All peoples have the right to maintain and develop their language, culture, and traditions. Freedom of education, expression, and religious activity is guaranteed to the maximum extent possible, as long as it does not involve harm to other peoples or incitement to hatred.</p></li><li><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong>: All peoples have the responsibility to respect the culture and history of other peoples and not to damage their dignity. Acts of asserting the superiority of one's own people and discriminating against or persecuting other peoples are subject to condemnation.</p></li></ol><h3 id="article-3-sharing-and-reconciliation-of-history">Article 3: Sharing and Reconciliation of History</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Joint Compilation of History</strong>: Between peoples with a history of conflict, joint history compilation projects shall be promoted under the supervision of THP. The purpose of this is not to impose a one-sided view of history, but to present multiple perspectives side-by-side and deepen mutual understanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prohibition of Oblivion</strong>: Genocide and crimes against humanity committed in the past must not be forgotten for any reason. The perpetrating people have an obligation to incorporate their historical responsibility into education and pass it on to future generations.</p></li></ol><h3 id="article-4-prohibited-practices">Article 4: Prohibited Practices</h3><p>The following practices are prohibited as "harmful customs" that violate universal human rights, regardless of any cultural or religious background used as an excuse:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Child marriage, forced marriage</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Honor killings</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Status discrimination such as the caste system</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Other inhumane practices designated by the THP Council of Human Decency</strong></p></li></ul><h3 id="article-5-horizontality-of-peoples">Article 5: Horizontality of Peoples</h3><p>All peoples, regardless of their population size, economic power, or military strength, are treated as equally horizontal beings. No people is permitted to claim a privileged position over other peoples. The principle of mutual recognition that "your truth and my truth can both be right" shall be the basis of inter-people relations.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>A people is not a community of fate bound by blood and soil, but a "cultural community" united by the will of mutual respect. This Charter will serve as a guide for diverse peoples to coexist and create the future together.</p></article><footer class="hr"></footer><footer><small class="muted">THP HTML Publish • 2025-09-17 22:02 UTC • Commit: insert-by-CI</small></footer></main></body></html>
