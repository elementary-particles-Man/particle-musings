Japan's "international contribution," Britain's "faded glory," Italy's "historical reconciliation," and Israel's "promised land." All of these have led to today's serious global conflicts and dysfunctions by relying on self-serving historical interpretations and avoiding a direct confrontation with a difficult past.</p><small class="muted">THP/English</small></div><div class="card"><h3><a href="./THP-2_Ethics_Charter.html">THP-2 Ethics Charter</a></h3><p>This charter defines the ethical foundation of the new world order to be built by The Horizon Protocol (THP). It faces the reality that conventional international law and theories of justice have become dysfunctional, and sets "maintenance of order" and "defense of humanity" as absolute standards. All states, organizations, and individuals will be evaluated based on the provisions of this charter, and the rightness or wrongness of their actions will be judged.</p><small class="muted">THP/English</small></div><div class="card"><h3><a href="./THP-3_People_Charter.html">THP-3 People Charter</a></h3><p>The history of the 20th century has been a repetition of tragedies in which peoples were linked to "states" in the name of nationalism, justifying their superiority over others and creating the seeds of conflict. The Horizon Protocol (THP) declares that it will settle this mistake and liberate peoples from the yoke of states and territories. A people in this charter is defined as a human group that shares history, culture, and language, and serves as a source of individual identity and spiritual support. All peoples, regardless of their size or the length of their history, are respected as equally horizontal beings.</p><small class="muted">THP/English</small></div><div class="card"><h3><a href="./THP-4_Religion_Charter.html">THP-4 Religion Charter</a></h3><p>The Horizon Protocol (THP) completely separates religion from the state and politics, and redefines it as belonging to the realm of individual inner spirituality. The basis for coexistence is to position empirical and verifiable "reality" as a common frame of reference above all religions and ideologies. Religion has the freedom to speak of hope and meaning in its respective doctrines on the basis of this common reality.</p><small class="muted">THP/English</small></div><div class="card"><h3><a href="./THP-5_Lexicon.html">THP-5 Lexicon</a></h3><p>The Horizon Protocol (THP) is a comprehensive framework for the survival and reconstruction of civilization in a post-Walpurgis world where existing political, economic, and social systems have become dysfunctional.

While the Ethics Charter provides an abstract and normative foundation (humanity, atonement, condemnation), this specification prioritizes concreteness and rigor. E-MAD defines how it is measured, executed, and governed, and ensures compatibility with each THP charter and operational dashboard.</p><small class="muted">THP/English</small></div></div></article><footer class="hr"></footer><footer><small class="muted">THP HTML Publish • 2025-09-17 23:03 UTC • Commit: insert-by-CI</small></footer></main></body></html>
