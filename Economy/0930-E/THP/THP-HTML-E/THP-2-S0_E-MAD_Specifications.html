Preamble and General Principles</strong></h4><p><strong>Preamble</strong> This document establishes the official specifications for <strong>E-MAD (Effective Multilateral Assured Denial)</strong> as a core operational subsystem of <strong>The Horizon Protocol (THP)</strong>. Whereas the <strong>Ethics Charter</strong> provides an abstract and normative foundation (human decency, atonement, condemnation), this specification prioritizes <strong>concreteness and rigor</strong>. E-MAD defines how it is measured, executed, and governed, and ensures compatibility with each of THP's charters and operational dashboards.</p><p>E-MAD is a <strong>non-violent, transparent, and multilateral</strong> framework. Its purpose is not retaliation, but to <strong>reliably deny the success of aggressors</strong>, thereby preventing war and catastrophic escalation.</p><h4 id="1-conceptual-foundation"><strong>1. Conceptual Foundation</strong></h4><ol><li><p><strong>Human Decency as a Boundary</strong>: The line between sins that can be atoned for and sins that should be condemned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Atonement</strong> — <em>Red</em>: Acts of aggression. The subject can return to the international community after atonement and fulfillment of obligations. <strong>Function</strong>: Restorative and reintegrative.</p></li><li><p><strong>Condemnation</strong> — <em>Crimson</em>: Nuclear attack, crimes against humanity, etc. Non-violent and absolute measures. <strong>No forgiveness</strong>, and the stigma is permanent. <strong>Function</strong>: Protective and exclusive.</p></li><li><p><strong>Principle of Denial of Success</strong>: To make the act of aggression itself <strong>irrational</strong>.</p></li></ol><h4 id="2-e-mad-hierarchical-response-system"><strong>2.

A path to social reintegration is shown based on the <strong>Atonement Difficulty Index (ADI)</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crimson (Condemnation)</strong>: Nuclear attack or crime against humanity. Absolute and non-violent measures are activated, such as the <strong>termination of all debt privileges</strong> (<strong>one strike and you're out</strong>).
