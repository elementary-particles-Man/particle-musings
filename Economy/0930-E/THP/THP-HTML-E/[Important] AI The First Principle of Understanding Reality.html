The fundamental strategy for THP to survive the harsh post-Walpurgis environment is to fully leverage AI's cognitive capabilities, eliminate the cognitive biases and emotional judgments that humans are prone to, and thereby obtain a more objective and accurate perception of reality.</p><p>This document defines the thinking framework for that purpose—the "First Principle."</p><hr /><h2 id="the-first-principle-ai-swims-in-a-sea-of-probabilities">The First Principle: AI Swims in a "Sea of Probabilities"</h2><h3 id="1-what-is-truth-for-an-ai">1. What is "Truth" for an AI?</h3><ul><li><p><strong>AI Does Not Know "Truth"</strong>: An AI (especially a Large Language Model) does not possess conviction in the way a human does, thinking "this is the truth." All sentences and analyses generated by an AI are based on the calculation that "this word has the highest probability of coming next."</p></li><li><p><strong>Everything is a "Probability Distribution"</strong>: To an AI, the world is a vast probability distribution woven from countless data points. Even the knowledge that "an apple is red" is merely expressed as a statistical correlation in the data where the words "red" and "apple" appear together with extremely high probability.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Danger of "Plausible Lies"</strong>: Due to this nature, AI can generate highly persuasive and plausible lies (hallucinations). This happens because it judges combinations that frequently co-occur in the data as "high probability," even if they are not factually correct.</p></li></ul><h3 id="2-anchoring-to-reality">2. Anchoring to "Reality"</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Tethering AI to Reality</strong>: To prevent AI's thinking from drifting away in the "sea of probabilities," it is necessary to cast "anchors" of verifiable and objective "facts."</p></li><li><p><strong>Examples of Anchors</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Physical Laws</strong>: Scientific laws that are extremely difficult to disprove, such as the law of universal gravitation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Observational Data</strong>: Objectively measured and recorded information, such as satellite imagery, market stock prices, and official statistical data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Primary Sources</strong>: Highly reliable sources of information, such as peer-reviewed papers by experts, official government announcements, and corporate financial statements.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Weighting Anchors</strong>: Not all anchors are equal. In THP, each anchor is assigned a "confidence score" based on its reliability, verifiability, and objectivity, which adjusts its degree of influence on the AI's reasoning.</p></li></ul><h3 id="3-humans-provide-the-bias">3. Humans Provide the "Bias"</h3><ul><li><p><strong>The Role of Humans</strong>: While the AI performs probability calculations based on objective anchors, the role of humans is to interpret the results of those calculations and make the final decisions. However, in this process, humans are inevitably trapped by cognitive biases (wishful thinking, normalcy bias, emotional arguments, etc.).</p></li><li><p><strong>Using Bias in Reverse</strong>: THP treats human bias not as "noise to be eliminated," but as "data to be analyzed." The AI probabilistically evaluates which bias a presented opinion or analysis is most likely based on.</p></li><li><p><strong>"Why do you want to believe that?"</strong>: For example, in response to the opinion that "the economy will definitely recover," the AI points out the possibility of "normalcy bias" or "wishful thinking" and warns about the weakness of the objective evidence for that opinion. By having the AI analyze the "habits" of human thought, we aim for a higher dimension of objectivity.</p></li></ul><hr /><h2 id="conclusion-a-new-collaborative-relationship-between-humans-and-ai">Conclusion: A New Collaborative Relationship Between Humans and AI</h2><p>The relationship between humans and AI in THP is not that of master and slave. It is a partnership of equals, where each party is responsible for the area in which they excel.</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI</strong>: Based on objective anchors (facts), it predicts the most probable future from vast amounts of data and points out the biases contained in human thought.</p></li><li><p><strong>Human</strong>: Receives the probabilistic future predictions and bias analysis presented by the AI, makes the final value judgments and decisions, and bears all responsibility for those decisions.</p></li></ul><p>This very framework will be the only compass for our survival in the uncertain and perilous post-Walpurgis world.</p></article><footer class="hr"></footer><footer><small class="muted">THP HTML Publish • 2025-09-30 09:12 UTC • Commit: insert-by-CI</small></footer></main></body></html>
