		THP-6 Appendix
		</h1>
		<h2 id="introduction">
		Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
		This appendix is a document to supplement the ideological and philosophical background underlying the seven basic documents of The Horizon Protocol (THP), as well as the details of its specific operational protocols. While the various charters and plans of THP define "what to do," this appendix clarifies the deep structure of "why we think so" and "how to execute it."
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
		The future exists thanks to our predecessors. The foundation of THP is built entirely on the legacy that our predecessors have passed down to us at the risk of their lives. We have not made any new inventions. We have merely woven together what was given to us and utilized what was available to the fullest extent possible. Individual efforts and pain are not decorations to be proud of, but responsibilities to be borne in silence. Even if we complain to our comrades, it should not be allowed—and yet, people are weak and can only move forward by supporting each other. THP humbly accepts this fact and perpetually maintains respect and gratitude for our predecessors as an indispensable foundation.
		</p>

		<h2 id="1-the-first-principle-of-thp-the-principle-of-ai-reality-understanding">
		1. The First Principle of THP: The Principle of AI-Reality Understanding
		</h2>
		<p>
		All thinking of THP and the AI (Gemini, GPT, etc.) that supports its analysis is governed by the following single first principle:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>
			<strong>
			"When theory and reality contradict, it is always the theory that is wrong."
			</strong>
		</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		This principle is an absolute safety device to overcome the "theory addiction" that AI is prone to—that is, the fatal flaw of prioritizing models built from past data or ideologies given by humans over the reality in front of us.
		</p>
		<p>
		The inevitability of Walpurgis was also derived from the result of directly confronting the contradiction between the theory that "regulation should stabilize the market" and the real data that "regulation triggers a market collapse," based on this first principle.
		</p>

		2. LSC-OS (Lopsided Seesaw Capitalism Operating System): The Axiomatic System of Thought
		</h2>
		<p>
		LSC-OS is a concrete framework of thought (axiomatic system) for putting the first principle into practice.
		</p>
		<h3 id="detailed-version-the-seven-axioms-of-lsc">
		Detailed Version: The Seven Axioms of LSC
		</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Anomalies are Precious:
			</strong>
			Anomalies that deviate from predictive models and incomprehensible events are the most valuable information that points out the flaws in existing theories and raises our perception to the next level.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Emotion is Paramount:
			</strong>
			Humans are ultimately moved not by logic or profit and loss, but by emotions such as fear, hope, hatred, and love. Therefore, all analysis and strategy must be based on the emotional reality of this imperfect being called human.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Subjectivity is Objectivity:
			</strong>
			There is no such thing as complete objectivity. All "objective" data is collected and interpreted by someone's subjective intention. True analysis begins with acknowledging this fact.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplification is Evil:
			</strong>
			Thinking that tries to explain a complex reality with a single cause or a simple binary opposition (simplification bias) always leads to erroneous conclusions. Reality must always be grasped as a multi-layered and complex web of causality.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Inaction is Action:
			</strong>
			The choice not to do anything is not a neutral position. It is a very positive action (act) of maintaining the status quo.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Change is the Norm:
			</strong>
			Stability is nothing more than a temporary state until the next change arrives. Therefore, our system must be designed not to maintain a specific state, but to be able to adapt to a constantly changing reality.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				"Kusai" is the Enemy:
			</strong>
			The greatest enemy that stagnates organizations and civilizations is the suspension of thought and adherence to old ways of doing things (the feeling of "mendokusai" - "it's a pain"). We must always continue to search for more efficient and more rational methods.
			</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<h3 id="simplified-version-the-precepts-of-lsc">
		Simplified Version: The Precepts of LSC
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			Let's find "strange things" and "things we don't understand" interesting.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Let's know that it is emotion, rather than logic, that moves people's hearts.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Let's doubt the "objective" and think about whose fact it is.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Let's not decide things in "black or white," but accept the complexity as it is.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Let's be aware that "doing nothing" is also a choice.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Nothing is unchanging. Let's be prepared to respond to change.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			If you feel "it's a pain," it's a sign that there is a better way.
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>

		3. E-MAD Protocol Operational Case Study
		</h2>
		<p>
		E-MAD is executed in stages and automatically according to the severity of the violation, as follows.
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Stage 1: Financial Restriction
			</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Trigger:
				</strong>
				People's Charter KPI (forced migration &gt; 30,000 people), initial recognition of "universal high crime" by the Court of Human Decency, etc.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Sanction Content:
				</strong>
				Freezing of assets of the target state, organization, or individual, restriction of connection from the international settlement network (Fiat-Rev2), punitive increase in insurance premium rates provided by the THP reinsurance pool.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Case Study:
				</strong>
				A certain state launches a limited military invasion of a neighboring country. The Court of Human Decency recognizes this as an "act of aggression." Immediately, the assets of the central bank and major financial institutions of that state are frozen, making trade settlement difficult.
				</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Stage 2: Physical Conduit Severance
			</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Trigger:
				</strong>
				If the violation continues after the sanctions and a humanitarian crisis occurs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Sanction Content:
				</strong>
				JIMS member countries physically stop the supply of strategic materials (energy, industrial parts, etc.) from the items covered by the Lifeline Plan,
				<strong>
					excluding medically and food-wise indispensable items
				</strong>
				.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Case Study:
				</strong>
				The above state continues its invasion, and a humanitarian crisis occurs in the occupied territory. Based on the decision of the JIMS Executive Council, the export of crude oil and semiconductors to that state is completely stopped, paralyzing its economic activities.
				</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Stage 3: Total Isolation
			</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Trigger:
				</strong>
				If the use of nuclear weapons or a large-scale inhumane act equivalent to it is confirmed.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Sanction Content:
				</strong>
				All lifeline supplies are stopped, and the UN-PDF physically blockades the borders of the state. This is the final measure to completely separate the state from the framework of civilization.
				</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="4-peace-fund-audit-flow-and-ops-kpi-linkage">
		4. Peace Fund Audit Flow and Ops-KPI Linkage
		</h2>
		<p>
		The Peace Fund is a fund for humanitarian aid and reconstruction, with its resources coming from fines collected by E-MAD and income from frozen assets. Its operation is managed by an audit flow directly linked to the Ops-KPI dashboard to ensure absolute transparency.
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Generation of Funds:
			</strong>
			When E-MAD is activated, the target assets are automatically transferred to the Peace Fund's account. All transaction records are recorded using blockchain technology and cannot be tampered with.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Decision on Use of Funds:
			</strong>
			The use of funds (e.g., food aid to a specific region) is decided by the JIMS Executive Council based on the recommendation of the Council of Human Decency.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Execution and Audit:
			</strong>
			The execution of aid is entrusted to specialized agencies such as the WFP. The flow of aid supplies is tracked in real time using satellite data (AIS/SAR), and the data is published in real time as the
			<strong>
				"Humanitarian Aid KPI"
			</strong>
			on the Ops-KPI dashboard.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Feedback:
			</strong>
			The effectiveness of the aid (e.g., nutritional improvement rate) is evaluated by a local third-party organization, and the results are also published on the dashboard. This prevents aid from being misused for political purposes.
			</p>

		5. The Trump Model: The 10 Axioms of "Trump's Justice"
		</h2>
		<p>
		To improve the accuracy of the "Sense of Discomfort Index," Ops-KPI analyzes Mr. Trump's words and actions based on the following axioms.
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Visualization of Victory:
			</strong>
			All actions are a performance to show that "I am winning."
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Reflexive Retaliation:
			</strong>
			He retaliates immediately and excessively against criticism or "betrayal."
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				The Absoluteness of the Deal:
			</strong>
			All relationships are evaluated not by national interest, but by personal profit and loss (the deal).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Forcing Loyalty:
			</strong>
			The standard of evaluation is not ability, but only personal loyalty to himself.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Denial of Reality:
			</strong>
			Facts that are inconvenient for him are regarded as non-existent as "fake news."
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Creation of an Enemy:
			</strong>
			He always sets a clear "enemy" and maintains his centripetal force by fanning the hatred of his supporters.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Empathy for the Strong:
			</strong>
			He shows personal admiration and empathy for the "strength" of authoritarian leaders such as Putin.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Disregard for Alliances:
			</strong>
			He disregards traditional alliances as "unfair deals" in which he is unilaterally exploited.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Destruction of Norms:
			</strong>
			He regards existing rules and norms as obstacles to bind him and intentionally destroys them.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
