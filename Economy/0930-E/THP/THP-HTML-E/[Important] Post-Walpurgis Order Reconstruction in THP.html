Foreword: Blueprint for a New Order</h2><p>Walpurgis will irreversibly destroy the existing international order, alliances, and governing structures. The resulting power vacuum will be a bifurcation point: either it will breed new chaos, or a more resilient and equitable new order will be born.</p><p>This document defines the specific organizational structure and role allocation for the latter, led by The Horizon Protocol (THP). This is a new architecture of governance that does not depend on a single hegemonic power but instead distributes functions and responsibilities, coordinating based on transparent rules.</p><h2 id="2-supreme-decision-making-body">2.
