		</h2>
		<p>
		Walpurgis will irreversibly destroy the existing international order, alliances, and governing structures. The resulting power vacuum will be a fork in the road, leading either to new chaos or to the birth of a more resilient and equitable new order.
		</p>
		<p>
		This paper defines the concrete organizational structure and role-sharing for the latter, led by The Horizon Protocol (THP). This is a new architecture of governance that does not depend on a single hegemonic power, but rather disperses functions and responsibilities and coordinates based on transparent rules.
