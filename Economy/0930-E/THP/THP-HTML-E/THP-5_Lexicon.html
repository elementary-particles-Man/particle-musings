		Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
		The Horizon Protocol (THP) is a comprehensive framework for ensuring the survival and reconstruction of civilization in a post-Walpurgis world, where existing political, economic, and social systems have ceased to function. This lexicon is intended to be an aid to understanding the unique concepts that make up THP and the ideas behind them.
		</p>
		<p>
		This document is written in a two-tiered structure: a
		<strong>
			"Detailed Version"
		</strong>
		that explains the ideological basis of THP, and a
		<strong>
			"Simplified Version"
		</strong>
		that explains the essence in plainer language.

		The Horizon Protocol (THP)
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			A comprehensive crisis response and civilization reconstruction protocol aimed at maintaining the minimum functions of human civilization and achieving a soft landing into a new framework for international cooperation (UN rev.2) in a world where the existing international order has collapsed due to Walpurgis. Its core consists of three pillars: stabilization of the financial system (Fiat-Rev2), securing the physical basis for survival (Lifeline Plan), and a new ethical code (E-MAD). THP is not a static plan, but a dynamic system based on LSC-OS that constantly dialogues with reality and continues to correct itself.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A comprehensive plan to protect our lives and create new world rules after a major global turmoil (Walpurgis). It is a compass for the future that advocates for stabilizing the flow of money, securing daily necessities such as water, food, and electricity, and a new sense of ethics to prevent conflicts from occurring.

		</ul>
		<h3 id="walpurgis">
		Walpurgis
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			A collective term for the global systemic financial crisis triggered by the failure of the US Treasury auction on September 30, 2025, and the accompanying geopolitical, social, and humanitarian complex disasters. This is not a cyclical economic crisis, but a collapse of order itself (Extinction-Level Event) caused by the structural defects of the global financial system built after the 2008 financial crisis (especially the procyclicality of SLR, CCP margin requirements) resonating with geopolitical tensions and social divisions.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			An unavoidable global catastrophe caused by a "configuration error" in the world's financial system. It is a "storm of calamities" in which not only economic problems but also all kinds of problems such as conflicts between nations and social turmoil erupt all at once.
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="lifeline-resource-plan">
		Lifeline Resource Plan
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			A practical plan to maintain minimum international logistics to prevent a humanitarian crisis even after the collapse of trade finance due to Walpurgis. Based on a minilateral agreement centered on Japan, India, Singapore, and Malaysia (JIMS), it combines a non-dollar-denominated alternative settlement rail with government-guaranteed trade finance (L/C guarantees, reinsurance pools). The target items are limited to lifeline resources related to water, medical care, electricity, and food.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A plan to ensure that the minimum necessities for our survival, such as water, medicine, electricity, and food, do not stop even if the world falls into chaos. It is a lifeline that secures safe transportation routes and new ways of paying for money by cooperating with reliable countries.

		E-MAD (Economically Mutually Assured Destruction)
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			A new framework for international security that forms the core of THP's ethics charter. In place of physical mutually assured destruction (MAD) by nuclear weapons, it deters state outbursts with the certainty that "an act that destroys order means immediate exclusion from the global economic system (= economic death)." Its execution is carried out in a phased and automatic manner based on the ruling of the Council of Human Decency, in the form of financial sanctions (exclusion from settlement networks), trade sanctions (cutting off lifelines), and exclusion from insurance and shipping.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A new way of thinking about security: "any country that breaks the rules will be immediately excluded from the global economy." It is a mechanism to prevent conflict, based on the reality that being economically isolated is more fatal to a nation than starting a war.
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="council-of-ethics-court-of-ethics">
		Council of Ethics / Court of Ethics
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			The supreme body that operates E-MAD and interprets the THP Ethics Charter. The
			<strong>
				Council
			</strong>
			is a higher concept responsible for deliberative functions such as discussing ethical norms and making policy recommendations. The
			<strong>
				Court
			</strong>
			is an executive body with a judicial function that judges whether a specific case falls under a "universal high crime" and approves the activation of E-MAD. Its members are composed of "symbols of civilization (the Four Sages)" who are considered to have a universal sense of ethics, independent of political and national interests.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A new international court to protect world peace and rules. It is a fair umpire that discusses "what is right" (the Council) and decides whether to impose penalties by E-MAD on countries and organizations that have broken the rules (the Court).
			</p>
		</li>

		UN-PDF (United Nations Peace Defense Force)
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			A new UN (UN rev.2) force to physically enforce the judgments of the Court of Human Decency and to ensure the safety of humanitarian corridors in the Lifeline Plan. Its composition is centered on the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Indian Armed Forces, with NTT's communication technology and general contractors' infrastructure restoration capabilities as complementary forces. The role of the US military is limited to logistical support (equipment, transportation, C4ISR). The use of force is permitted only under extremely limited circumstances based on the Rules of Engagement (ROE).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A new UN force to protect world peace with "power." It is the last resort that works to protect humanitarian aid routes and to make countries that have broken the rules obey.

		Tax
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			From the perspective of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), taxes are
			<strong>
				not a source of government revenue
			</strong>
			. A government that can issue its own currency does not need to collect taxes from the public in advance for its expenditures. The true role of taxes can be summarized in the following three points:
			</p>
			<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Inflation control:
				</strong>
				Absorb purchasing power from the private sector and curb economic overheating (inflation).
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Wealth redistribution:
				</strong>
				Correct inequality and maintain social stability.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				<strong>
					Creating demand for currency:
				</strong>
				By imposing a tax obligation on the public, it creates a permanent demand for the currency issued by the government (e.g., the Japanese yen) and guarantees its value.
				</p>
			</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			Many people think that the purpose of taxes is to collect money for the government to spend, but their real role is different. Taxes are an
			<strong>
				important tool for adjusting the balance of the economy
			</strong>
			, to prevent prices from rising too much (inflation control), to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor (redistribution), and above all, to give the "Japanese yen" the seal of approval that "it has value because it is needed for tax payments."
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="household-budget-fallacy">
		Household Budget Fallacy
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			The erroneous idea of likening national finance to the logic of a household budget, which should cover expenditures within the scope of income (tax revenue). A government that can issue its own currency, unlike households and companies, will not go bankrupt in the currency it issues. This fallacy justifies austerity during deflationary periods and provides an ideological basis for prolonging economic stagnation.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			The idea that "the national debt is a big problem, we have to save money just like a household" is actually a mistake. The rules are fundamentally different for a family that cannot create its own money and a country that can create money (the Japanese yen). This misunderstanding is the cause of cutting necessary public services and making everyone poorer.
			</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="fiat-rev2">
		Fiat-Rev2
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			A new international monetary system to replace the US dollar-based system that collapsed at Walpurgis. Its core consists of a swap network of the Japanese yen, which is the only currency that can maintain confidence, and regional key currencies such as the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real, backed by Japan's credit guarantees. The settlement of energy and important materials is carried out through this non-dollar-denominated currency basket and alternative settlement systems such as mBridge.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A new money system to be used in a world where the dollar is no longer trusted. By centering on the Japanese "yen" and enabling direct exchange between the currencies of reliable countries, it enables stable trade.

		LSC-OS (Lopsided Seesaw Capitalism Operating System)
		</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Detailed Version:
			</strong>
			The operating system of thought that forms the basis of THP. Based on the first principle that "when reality and theory contradict, it is always the theory that is wrong," it is a way of thinking that eliminates fixed ideas and ideologies and constantly searches for the optimal solution while dialoguing with real data. Its axioms include principles that look directly at the reality of human behavior, which is different from conventional rationalism, such as "abnormality is precious" and "emotion is the strongest."
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Simplified Version:
			</strong>
			A knack for thinking, "Don't be a blockhead, look at reality properly" and "Stop doing troublesome things and do it smarter." It is a flexible way of thinking for constantly reviewing the way of doing things while valuing actual data and human emotions, not just armchair theories.
