		THP-2: Ethics Charter
		</h1>
		<h3 id="preamble">
		Preamble
		</h3>
		<p>
		This Charter defines the ethical foundation of the new world order established by The Horizon Protocol (THP). It directly confronts the reality that conventional international law and theories of justice have become dysfunctional, and establishes the "maintenance of order" and the "defense of human decency" as absolute standards. All nations, organizations, and individuals will be evaluated and their actions judged based on the articles of this Charter.
		</p>
		<h2 id="scope-of-application">
		Scope of Application
		</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			Condemnation under this Charter is limited to universal high crimes (mass civilian casualties, systematic persecution, repeated aggression). Individual political disputes are not subject to this Charter.
			</p>

		Priority of Universal Human Rights over Culture and Religion (Connection to the People's Charter)
		</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			Cultural and religious practices are protected, but if they conflict with universal human rights, the said practices are invalidated. This is in accordance with the "List of Prohibited Practices" in the People's Charter.

		Article 1: Fundamental Principle: Affirmation of Life and Primacy of Order
		</h3>
		<h4 id="detailed-version">
		Detailed Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		All life is, in principle, affirmed in its existence. However, this affirmation is not unconditional; the maintenance of "order" as defined by THP takes precedence. Human rights are not defined as natural rights, but as acquired rights guaranteed for the first time by THP's order and the laws based on it. These rights may be restricted for entities that threaten order.
		</p>
		<h4 id="simplified-version">
		Simplified Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		(A version that simplifies the key points of the research version into legal text. Terminology should be consistent with the Lexicon.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Everyone's life is very important. But the "order" for everyone to live in peace is even more important. Human rights are guaranteed only by protecting this order.
		</p>

		Article 2: Definition of Sin: Destruction of Order and Challenge to Human Decency
		</h3>
		<h4 id="detailed-version-1">
		Detailed Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		"Sin" in THP is broadly divided into the following two categories:
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Acts that destroy order itself
			</strong>
			: All acts that fundamentally undermine the foundations of global stability as defined by THP, such as inviting foreign aggression, destruction of critical infrastructure through cyber-attacks, and intentional disruption of the key currency system.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Acts that defy human decency
			</strong>
			: Grave challenges to humanity, the foundation of civilization, such as genocide, planned massacres of defenseless civilians, nuclear blackmail, and the use of inhumane biological and chemical weapons.
			</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
		<h4 id="simplified-version-1">
		Simplified Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		(A version that simplifies the key points of the research version into legal text. Terminology should be consistent with the Lexicon.)
		</p>
		<p>
		In the world of THP, "sin" is one of two things:
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
			Intentionally breaking the rules and systems that allow everyone to live in peace.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
			Doing something that is "absolutely unforgivable as a human being" (→ see Lexicon: Human Decency).
			</p>
		</li>
		</ol>

		Article 3: Atonement: Return to the International Community
		</h3>
		<h4 id="detailed-version-2">
		Detailed Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		"Atonement" is the official process for settling past sins and returning to the international community. This is not a mere pardon, but is accompanied by the fulfillment of responsibility and a pledge to prevent recurrence. Approval is declared in the name of the
		<strong>
			Council of Human Decency
		</strong>
		, based on the procedures and sentencing of the
		<strong>
			Court of Human Decency
		</strong>
		. The Four Sages are advisory (no vote).
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
			<strong>
				Judicial Body
			</strong>
			: The
			<strong>
				Court of Human Decency
			</strong>
			is responsible for legal proceedings and sentencing, and the
			<strong>
				final judgment is declared in the name of the Council of Human Decency
			</strong>
			.

		</ul>
		<h4 id="simplified-version-2">
		Simplified Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		(A version that simplifies the key points of the research version into legal text. Terminology should be consistent with the Lexicon.)
		</p>
		<p>
		"Atonement" (→ see Lexicon) means to make up for the sins you have committed, to have your "I'm sorry" accepted by the world, and to be welcomed back as a member.
		</p>
		<h3 id="article-4-condemnation-the-irreversible-historical-brand">
		Article 4: Condemnation: The Irreversible Historical Brand
		</h3>
		<h4 id="detailed-version-3">
		Detailed Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		"Condemnation" is the final ethical judgment handed down without room for salvation to an entity that has committed a universal high crime against humanity. The Court of Human Decency is responsible for legal proceedings and sentencing, and the final judgment is declared in the name of the Council of Human Decency (the Council of Human Decency is responsible for deliberation and recommendations). Political condemnation is excluded (hearings are held only when a universal high crime is applicable). This condemnation is an irreversible historical brand that will not be overturned by any change in era or political situation.

		</h4>
		<p>
		(A version that simplifies the key points of the research version into legal text. Terminology should be consistent with the Lexicon.)
		</p>
		<p>
		"Condemnation" (→ see Lexicon) means to be eternally engraved in history as an unforgivable sin.
		</p>
		<h3 id="article-5-enforcement-e-mad-protocol">
		Article 5: Enforcement: E-MAD Protocol
		</h3>
		<h4 id="detailed-version-4">
		Detailed Version
		</h4>
		<p>
		The enforcement of this Charter shall, in principle, be by non-violent economic and financial means, and its operation shall be in accordance with the "E-MAD (Effective Multilateral Assured Denial)" protocol¹. Sanctions by force are permitted only under strict conditions as a last resort against a condemned entity.
		</p>

		</h4>
		<p>
		(A version that simplifies the key points of the research version into legal text. Terminology should be consistent with the Lexicon.)
		</p>
		<p>
		Punishment for those who break the rules of this Charter will be automatically carried out by an economic mechanism called E-MAD (→ see Lexicon).
