      <h2>1. Name and Multilayered Identity</h2>
      <p>
        This project does not rely on a single name, but has multiple faces depending on the situation.<br>
        <strong>The Horizon Protocol (THP)</strong> is the flagship name and the central designation used in internal documents and official records.<br>
        Academically, it is positioned as the <strong>Pax Communis – Accordia Framework (PCAF)</strong> and is responsible for the ideological and theoretical framework.<br>
        <strong>Project Genesis (PG)</strong> is used for general public relations to intuitively convey the "genesis of a new world" to people.<br>
        <strong>The Kyrios Framework (KF)</strong> is used for institutional design and financial protocols to provide stability to regulations and international agreements.<br>
        Also, from a historical perspective, the name <strong>Ark-R</strong> remains, indicating continuity from past projects.

      <h2>2. Basic Concept</h2>
      <p>
        The foundation of THP is "transparency, fairness, and non-hegemony." It is an implementation structure for universally protecting life and order, abandoning the narrative of hegemony and superiority.<br>
        It is not just an economic bailout, but a redesign of the entire order, including humanity, ethnicity, religion, and ethics.<br>
        It is not just a philosophy, but is practically defined by <strong>seven basic documents</strong>, bridging the three layers of institutions, norms, and operations.

      <h2>3. Overview of the Seven Basic Documents</h2>
      <h3>① World Redefinition Charter</h3>
      <p>
        This document buries the old narrative of the world order and declares the starting point of a new story.<br>
        It universalizes the standard that "those who break the order are guilty" and institutionalizes atonement and condemnation. It sets the three pillars of transparency, fairness, and accuracy as its banner.
      </p>

      <h3>② Ethics-Charter</h3>
      <p>
        It defines universal human sin and atonement, and presents a new framework for the judiciary, military, and police to ensure order.<br>
        It specifies practical institutional designs such as the Hague Ethical Court (Court of Human Ethics), the International Police (ICPO-2), and the War Prevention Force (UN-PDF).
      </p>

      <h3>③ People-Charter</h3>
      <p>
        All peoples are horizontal and are beings to be respected by each other.<br>
        It codifies the principles of freedom of peoples, respect for culture, denial of superiority, and coexistence, and denies exclusion and discrimination as destruction of order.
      </p>

      <h3>④ Religion-Charter</h3>
      <p>
        Based on the major premise that "your religion is also right, and my religion is also right," it balances freedom of belief and respect for science.<br>
        It defines religion as a path to save people and denies cults and the use of violence.
      </p>

      <h3>⑤ Lexicon</h3>
      <p>
        This is a basic dictionary that organizes the concepts and technical terms used in THP.<br>
        It provides a common language for understanding the entire project, including THP, Walpurgis, Fiat-Rev2, Peace Utility Layer, and E-MAD.
      </p>

      <h3>⑥ Ops-KPI-Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        A "health checkup" that diagnoses the state of the world with numbers.<br>
        It constantly monitors US Treasury auction bid-to-cover ratios, the dollar index, Chinese LGFV debt, European government bond spreads, etc., and enables automatic intervention (swaps, redundancy) in advance of a crisis.
      </p>

      <h3>⑦ Appendix (LSC)</h3>
      <p>
        This is an ideological addendum to LSC (Libra/Scales Capitalism), and its principle is to "start from reality and improve reality" through seven core propositions.<br>
        It is a thinking OS that emphasizes improvement rather than innovation and supports order while constantly changing its form.

      <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The seven documents are not just a collection of ideas, but a feasible manual for maintaining order in a crisis.<br>
        They are independent yet complementary, and are a guide to lead all of humanity to a "future where no one is left behind."<br>
        Through its multilayered identity and the seven documents, THP institutionalizes the trinity of market, life, and humanity, and becomes a practical prescription for overcoming a historic turning point.
