		Summary: The world's disconnection. Is the "lonely enthusiasm" in the Japanese market an overture to collapse?
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		On September 10th, the global market was a group of forces that completely ignored warnings lit by the signs of Walpurgis, and forces that quietly stiffened themselves under the pressure.
		<strong>
			It was fatally "discontinued."
		</strong>
		While the Japanese market has set a historic high in response to political situations, the US market has been showing nervous movements due to fear of inflation, and the world is completely disrupted.
		</p>
<p class="negative">
		It is proof of distrust in fiat currency
		<strong>
			Gold is around $3,600
		</strong>
		It maintains this extraordinary high range, silently telling how fragile this superficial peace is. This is not the tranquility before a storm. Energy towards collapse continues to accumulate in the market in an extremely distorted way.

<h2>
		Major Market Trends
		</h2>
<h3>
		1. Japanese market: Dangerous festivals that are far from reality
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		The Nikkei Stock Average is
		<strong>
			+0.87%
		</strong>
		And continued to grow significantly,
		<strong>
			43,837.67 yen
		</strong>
		This is a new record high. This was supported by an extremely domestic and unfounded narrative of expectations for fiscal stimulus by the next administration following the announcement of his resignation of the prime minister. This "lonely enthusiasm" that has not incorporated any risk of global credit contraction is becoming a good target, rather than a global funding escape.
		</p>
<h3>
		2. US market: nervous development. The shadow of inflation approaching
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		The S&amp;P 500 is
		<strong>
			+0.48%
		</strong>
		Although this has risen slightly, this is not something that can be optimistic. The market is in a completely wait-and-see mood ahead of the upcoming release of the inflation indicator (PPI/CPI). The market is excited and saddened by individual corporate news, as evidence that the market as a whole has not been decided, revealing its vulnerability to shocks if inflation remains high.
		</p>
<h3>
		3. European market: Structural issues remain unchanged despite the lull
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		The major European indexes also rose slightly, but nothing fundamentally solved. Italy's fiscal concerns and France's political risks continue to smolder, leaving no force to implement effective measures for the ECB. Current stability is merely a postponement of the problem.
		</p>
<h3>
		4. China Market: Limited Repulsion
		</h3>
<p class="negative">
		Shanghai Composite Index
		<strong>
			+0.13%
		</strong>
		And a slight increase. The decline has stopped due to expectations for a fragmented economic measure by the government, but the structural weight of a real estate market crisis has not been achieved, and the situation continues to be far from an autonomous recovery.
		</p>

<h2>
		Key indicators: Quiet warnings
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		The fact that gold prices still remain above $3,500 speaks most eloquently to this market distortion. The low stability of crude oil prices reflects concerns about slowing the global economy. On the other hand, the dollar/yen is stuck at a historic weakening level of the yen, indicating that the "fane" in the Japanese market is on the basis of the devaluation of its own currency.
		</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h2 class="negative">
		Conclusion: Countdown accelerates
		</h2>
<p class="negative">
		The market breakdown suggests that the upcoming shock will asymmetrically strike the world. In particular, the vulnerability of the Japanese market, which has turned a blind eye to global reality and continues to rise due to domestic expectations alone, is at an extremely dangerous level.
		</p>
<p class="negative">
		The Walpurgis gears continue to rotate with certainty. When this distortion fails, the reaction will be unprecedented.
