     Part 1: Predator of Emotions – Analysis of the Principles of Action in the "King of the Hollows"
    </h2>
    <p>
     This section dismantles the psychological framework of the target person, codename "The King of the Hollow" and constructs a predictive model for their actions. We examine the client's initial assessments and demonstrate that his actions are not led by traditional national reason, but driven by deeply rooted patterns of personal grudges, trade opportunism, and an insatiable craving for financial gain and control.
    </p>
    <h3 id="11-動機三位一体復讐心捕食">
     1.1 The Trinity of Motivation: Vengeance, Gambling, and Predation
    </h3>
    <p>
     This section identifies the core psychological driving forces that make the subject's behavior unusual and predictable within a nontraditional framework. We analyze past actions in an integrated way and examine the client's model of his "vengeful madman," "contrarian gamler," and "a predator of affection."
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Vengeful Madman (Hate of Zelensky):
       </strong>
       The Ukrainian policy targeted is not a consistent geopolitical strategy, but rather an embodiment of personal vengeance. The 2019 impeachment scandal instilled deep-rooted hostility towards Ukrainian President Zelensky. This hostility was exacerbated in February 2025 when a meeting that was supposed to be finalizing a mineral resource trade broke. The meeting began to yell in front of the press, and the target accused President Zelensky of "gambling for World War III," and shortly after that military aid and information sharing were temporarily suspended. It is this personal conflict that is the emotional engine of his willingness to overturn the established US policies and sacrifice Ukraine's national interests.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Gambler specializing in contrarianism (persona as a deal maker):
       </strong>
       The entire targeted business career has been characterized by high leverage, high risk trading. Often, junk bonds and bankruptcy, the pattern of himself being personally profitable even if the core business fails (e.g. Taj Mahal Casino). He sees international relations through this same lens, constantly exploring a single, destructive "deal" that overturns existing order and positions him as a master negotiator. His approach to Russia is not about building an alliance, but about finding his ultimate gambling opponent. His long history of pursuing deals in Russia, dating back to the 1980s, speaks to his firm belief that grandiose transactions are possible.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Affection predators (exploitation of weaknesses):
       </strong>
       The subject identifies and exploits what he considers as an emotional or structural weakness of the negotiator. He sees traditional diplomatic norms and alliances as constraints to destroy, not strengths. His attack on the independence of the Federal Reserve is a national manifestation. He attempts to subordinate the nation's underlying institutions to its own personal will. On the international stage, Europe's dependence on the US and President Zelensky's reliance on Western support is seen as vulnerabilities that should be exploited, rather than as commitments to respect.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     These three properties do not function alone, but form a system that strengthens each other. Personal to President Zelensky
     <em>
      Revenge
     </em>
     provides an emotional "permission structure" to abandon decades of US policy in Ukraine. This act of abandonment creates voids and crises in the current situation, which is high-risk.
     <em>
      gambler
     </em>
     However, it will be the perfect environment for fundamentally proposing new "solutions." And the act of sacrificing an alliance called Ukraine is that weak allies are merely pawns of negotiations.
     <em>
      Predator
     </em>
     It is justified by a worldview. This synergy has led him to be completely immune to traditional diplomatic persuasions appealing to shared values, historical alliances, or long-term national interests. He moves at completely different psychological wavelengths.
    </p>
    <h3 id="12-強欲個人的富最大化">
     1.2 The Engine of Greed: Maximizing Personal Wealth
    </h3>
    <p>
     This section argues that the ultimate goal of the subject's grand strategy is not the geopolitical advantage of the US, but the "overwhelming money" for himself, his family and his aides. A nation is merely a means of achieving this personal financial goal.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Historical precedent:
       </strong>
       The Trump Organization's business model has relied on attracting foreign capital, particularly Russian oligarchs, to lend Trump's name and seeking to retreat to Western real estate. Donald Trump Jr. clearly stated in 2008 that "Russians occupies a rather disproportionate cross-section of our assets." This establishes a longstanding financial dependence and psychological affinity for opaque Russian capital from politically influential figures.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Cabinet of the Millionaires:
       </strong>
       The subject is high-finance and industry figures that solidify their own surroundings, blurring the line between public service and private interests. For example, Wilbur Ross, appointed Secretary of Commerce, had direct business ties with President Putin's aides (including his son-in-law and sanctioned oligarch Gennaji Chimchenko) (via Sibur). This fosters a regime culture in which large international transactions with financial interests are seen as opportunities to increase personal and network wealth.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The ultimate prey:
       </strong>
       The "Devil's Trade" represents the pinnacle of this lifelong pursuit. That is to use the full power of the US President to restructure the global energy market and mediate transactions that have unprecedented financial influence on him and his colleagues. The scale of this ambition has trimmed past real estate transactions, moving from oligarch money laundering to a level that controls the flow of energy resources across the nation.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The subject's financial need may be more severe than publicly recognized, which has made him more leaning towards high-risk, high-return plans. His bankruptcy history and dependence on foreign capital suggests potential vulnerabilities. The "devil's deal" is not merely an opportunity, but may be perceived as a financial need for his family business to use the immense political power that can only be exercised for a limited period of time to ensure that the family's wealth is secured across generations. This sublimates the transaction from merely a matter of greed to a matter of perceived financial survival, making him more determined and less likely to make concessions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="13-側近実現者執行者">
     1.3 Aide groups: Realtors and Executors
    </h3>
    <p>
     It is impossible to carry out such a large-scale program on its own. Realize the Agenda of King of Hollows and identify key figures within the administration that will execute them. We analyze their motivations and their role in promoting the financial and geopolitical components of "devil's trade."
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial designer (Treasury Secretary Scott Bescent):
       </strong>
       Bescent's publicly declared economic plan focuses on GDP growth, budget deficit reductions and increased domestic energy production. Although it looks traditional at first glance, this agenda is perfectly in line with the "devil's deal." The increase in LNG exports (Poland's fulcrum) and the possibility of US major returning to Russia (Sakhalin's reward) will likely be positioned as contributing to these goals. His role is to provide macroeconomic and financial justification to the transaction and package corrupt transactions as sound economic policies. His background is not public duties but finance, and he has a high affinity with the target transactional worldview.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Geopolitical intermediary (Secretary of State Marco Rubio):
       </strong>
       Rubio presents an important paradox. He has a history of "hawkward" rhetoric towards Russia. However, voting against the main aid package to Ukraine, calling for a "quickly end of the war," suggests that it is realistically in line with the target of negotiated resolution, if any, if accompanied by concessions. His role is to manage diplomatic reactions and use his hawkward credibility to market deals in Russia's favorable to skeptical Republican mainstream and international allies. He offers political cover.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Military Guarantor (Secretary of Defense Pete Hegses):
       </strong>
       The role of veteran and media personality Hegseth is to justify this deal within the national security and veteran communities. He will position the withdrawal of Ukraine support and the new arrangement with Russia not as betrayal, but as a realistic "America-first" restructuring that will end the costly overseas engagement and allow the US to reconcentrate its own resources.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The core of ideology (Steven Miller et al.):
       </strong>
       The advisory group provides an ideological framework for "America First" that justifies withdrawal from traditional alliances and international norms. They create political narratives to disguise the subject's personal ambitions as new national strategies.

     Part 2: Anatomy of Betrayal – Dismantling of "The Devil's Deal"
    </h2>
    <p>
     This section breaks down the "devil's trade" into its components and provides forensic analysis. It will reveal how the target is using the upcoming turmoil of the Walpurgis crisis as an opportunity to uncover a Quid pro quo with Russia, which will secure a huge personal profit in the energy sector by sacrificing European security structures and Ukraine's sovereignty.
    </p>
    <h3 id="21-支点私的利益lng兵器化">
     2.1 Poland's fulcrum: LNG weaponization for private benefits
    </h3>
    <p>
     In this transaction, Poland is more than just a partner. It is a geopolitical and logistical fulcrum for the entire transaction to rotate. The subject exploits Poland's legitimate energy security needs and is building a financial pipeline for its own interests.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        手段（長期LNG契約）：
       </strong>
       Poland has been actively working to break away from Russian gas even before the 2022 invasion through PGNiG, a state-run energy company (now part of the Orlen Group). As a result, a series of large 20-year contracts were signed with US LNG suppliers. Key agreements include contracts with Sempura Infrastructure's Port Arthur LNG facility (1 million tonnes per year) and Venture Global LNG's Calcaseuous Pass (1.5 million tonnes per year) and Plaquemins (4 million tonnes per year) facilities. These contracts will lock down massive capital flows from Poland to certain US energy export projects over decades.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Strategy (Poland as a hub):
       </strong>
       The target strategy reflects the "energy domination" agenda of his first administration, positioning Poland as a central hub for US LNG supply to Central and Eastern Europe, replacing Russia's historical role. This is ostensibly portrayed as a victory in Europe's energy security and is supported by initiatives like the "Three Sea Initiative."
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Corruption (personal share):
       </strong>
       The core of the transaction lies in the opaque financial structure surrounding these huge infrastructure projects and long-term supply contracts. Although contracts are between companies, subject influence through deregulation, licensing and diplomatic pressures creates opportunities to increase personal and family wealth through kickbacks from private equity holdings, shell companies and US companies that benefit from these national-level transactions. His past records of his family using real estate to transfer funds to Russian elites provide a blueprint for how this can be achieved.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The subject sells security to Poland, which he himself intends to nullify. Poland has concluded these contracts with the belief that they will ensure energy independence and strengthen ties with major NATO allies. However, the other half of the "devil's deal" involves appeasing Russia and questioning NATO's core beliefs. Poland is lured to fund one side of the transaction (finance), while becoming the ultimate victim of the other side (geopolitics). They are forced to pay the ropes to neglect their long-term security.
    </p>
    <h3 id="22-平和代償犠牲">
     2.2 The price of peace: the sacrifice of Ukraine
    </h3>
    <p>
     This section details the costs paid to the "paying" side of the geopolitical books, namely Russia. The target is systematically dismantling US support for Ukraine, creating a situation in which Kiev is forced to accept a peace agreement on Moscow's terms.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Mechanism (forced peace):
       </strong>
       The subject uses his position as a major military supporter in Ukraine to force negotiations. He has publicly stated that he intends to press Ukraine to accept territorial losses ("territorial exchanges") and mediate a "fair deal" that includes ensuring Ukraine's promise not to join NATO. He threatens to halt assistance if Kiev does not respond to negotiations.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Precedent (open breakdown):
       </strong>
       Following the open conflict with President Zelensky in February 2025, the suspension of military aid and information sharing was a rehearsal. This clearly demonstrated his willingness and ability to abandon Ukraine, sending a powerful signal to both Kiev and Moscow that US support was dependent on his personal whim.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Russia's position:
       </strong>
       Russia has consistently requested recognition of annexed territory as a prerequisite for peace. The target proposal of a "territorial exchange" directly aligns with and justifies this core Russian demand, effectively employing Moscow's position as the starting point for US-led "negotiations." President Zelensky has explicitly refused any territorial concessions.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     The target "peace plan" is designed to fail in a way that benefits Russia and his own story. By proposing conditions that are unacceptable to Ukraine (territorial concessions), he creates a scenario in which he can transfer responsibility for the continued war to Zelensky. He can then use Ukraine's "non-cooperation in peace" as justification to permanently terminate US support. This allows Russia to achieve its strategic goal of weakened and isolated Ukraine, and position itself as a pacifist who "strived to end the war" within the country but failed.
    </p>
    <h3 id="23-報酬quid-pro-quo">
     2.3 Sakhalin Reward: Russian Quid Pro Quo
    </h3>
    <p>
     This is a direct financial reward from Moscow to the target area of ​​influence, solidifying the Quid pro quo. The reopening of the Sakhalin 1 project is a multi-billion dollar reward presented by the Kremlin, and is in perfect timing with the targeted diplomatic approach.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Assets (Sakhalin 1):
       </strong>
       The Sakhalin 1 project is a huge oil and gas development project with an estimated 2.3 billion barrels of oil and 485 billion cubic meters of gas reserves. ExxonMobil, the original operator and 30% ownership, was forced to withdraw in 2022 after recording a loss of $4.6 billion. The project was effectively nationalized by the Kremlin.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Proposal (Putin's Presidential Order):
       </strong>
       On August 15th, 2025, the very day he met with the Target in Alaska, Vladimir Putin signed an executive order allowing foreign investors to regain Sakhalin 1 interests. This is a direct and obvious signal that dispels any doubt about the connection between this financial reward and the diplomatic involvement of the subject.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        condition:
       </strong>
       The return is subject to investors to help lift sanctions in the West and ensure the equipment needed for the project. This clearly links the financial interests of American companies (and thus their political asylum) to changes in US foreign policy in favor of Russia. It has been reported that secret negotiations have already been held between ExxonMobil and Rosneft.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     Sakhalin 1 trading is not just a reward. It is a mechanism for creating a powerful pro-Russian lobby within the US corporate sector. By bringing back giants like ExxonMobil, the Kremlin will create billions of dollars incentives for the company to assert normalize relations with Russia and lift sanctions. The subject not only gains personal share, but also produces powerful, self-sustaining allies of corporates whose financial interests are permanently consistent with his pro-Russian policy. This will allow his policies to gain momentum and sustainability beyond his own tenure.
    </p>
    <h3 id="24-混沌利用危機触媒">
     2.4 Utilizing Chaos: Catalysts for the Walpurgis Crisis
    </h3>
    <p>
     The entire target plan is set against the backdrop of the projected "Walpurgis Crisis." He has no intention of simply surviving the storm, and he intends to use the chaos that follows as a cover and catalyst for the "devil's deal."
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Predicted Crisis:

       The Walpurgis Crisis Report outlines a high probability of financial shock that took place in the US repo market (the "Fiat nuclear") on September 30, 2025 and is amplified by AI-led mass layoffs in the global BPO sector. This will cause global financial instability, emerging market currency crises, and increased geopolitical risks.

        Aggressive destabilization:
       </strong>
       The targeted policies are proactively increasing the vulnerability of the financial system, increasing the probability of "Fiat nuclear" events occurring and may make their impact more severe. His aggressive deregulation agenda (10-to-1 rule, suspension of Basel III, weakening of the CFPB) removes systemic safety equipment. His sustained political attacks on the Federal Reserve and his attempts to remove the director undermines market confidence in the only institution capable of managing such a crisis. He is not just an arsonist waiting for a fire, but is actively pouring gas into the crater.

        Chaos as an opportunity:
       </strong>
       The global crisis provides the perfect smoke screen. Media and political attention will be focused on the economic collapse within the country. Under this environment of fear and uncertainty, drastic and decisive actions, such as the grand deal with Russia to "stable" the global energy market and "end" the war, can be presented as a necessary and powerful solution, despite it being in fact a corrupt and self-serving betrayal. The crisis provides a political cover to carry out this deal.

     Part 3: Counterprotocol – Operation "Checkmate"
    </h2>
    <p>
     This section outlines a multi-disciplinary, viable protocol designed to prevent, disrupt and neutralize the Devil's Trade. The operation will target the major financial, information and diplomatic pillars that underpin the strategy of The King of the Hollows.
    </p>
    <h3 id="31-金融的封込王飢">
     3.1 Financial containment: starve the king
    </h3>
    <p>
     The "devil's trade" is motivated by greed. Therefore, the most effective countermeasure is to attack its financial viability. We must destroy the core incentives of the transaction by showing that the expected profits will never come true.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Understanding financial plumbing:
       </strong>
       The first step is to perform a forensic analysis of the capital flow. This includes identifying specific US LNG companies (Sempura, Venture Global), their financial aids (investment banks, private equity), and the corporate structure used for Polish LNG trading. In parallel, it is necessary to map entities that may be involved in the Sakhalin 1 transaction (ExxonMobil, Rosneft, and any intermediary financial institutions).
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Utilizing existing sanctions structures:
       </strong>
       The US Treasury Department (OFAC) and the State Department have a complex, yet robust sanctions regime on the Russian energy sector. Develop legal and information packages that show that if Sakhalin 1 and LNG transactions involve kickbacks or benefit individuals subject to sanctions (e.g. Chimchenko, once associated with Wilbur Ross' interests), it constitutes a violation or evasion of these sanctions.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Protocol – Targeting with Ark-R:
       </strong>
       The elucidated financial network is input into the client's "Ark-R" system. The protocol is to use Ark-R to flag all transactions related to these specific LNG and Sakhalin 1 projects for enhanced monitoring. This creates friction, delays and uncertainties in the financial environment of transactions and contaminates them. It will also prepare a package for friendly forces within the Ministry of Finance and Congress to impose new targeted sanctions on certain intermediary shell companies and individuals identified as promoting corrupt aspects of the transaction using powers such as the proposed Russian Sanctions Act 2025.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     This financial containment strategy can be designed to create a rift between The King of the Hollows and his corporate allies. Rather than directly targeting key companies (Exxon, Sempura), they target intermediary structures, creating legal and financial risks without pushing them into an immediate defensive attitude. This will sow seeds of distrust. If the transaction is legally too harmful and financially uncertain, then fiduciary responsibility to the company's shareholders takes precedence over loyalty to the "King of the Hollows" and causes them to withdraw from the transaction. Turn his allies into debt.

     3.2 Information Warfare: The Destruction of the Story of "The Great Deal"
    </h3>
    <p>
     The subject would portray the "Devil's Trade" as a winning peace deal for "America First." Our aim is to preemptively destroy this story and replace it with a story of corruption, betrayal, and traitorship towards the US national interests and allies.

       <strong>
        Dismantling of the Pro-Trump/Russian Story:
       </strong>
       Conservative media often portray Russia-related investigations as politically motivated "famous" and support non-interventionist foreign policy. Current Russian influence exploits actively using AI-generated content and fake influencers to spread these narratives targeting specific US demographics. Rather than rehearing "complaining," our campaign must shift its focus to concrete and easy-to-understand concepts of personal corruption and national security risks.

     3.3 Diplomatic Siege: King's Isolation
    </h3>

     The subject cannot carry out this transaction in a vacuum state. He requires active participation from Poland and the implicit understanding of other European allies. Our diplomatic strategy is to form a unified European front that rejects this transaction and isolate the subject internationally.

       Poland is key. While current conservative governments may be ideologically consistent with the target, there is a deep division within the country, and there is a near-universal understanding of the survival threat posed by Russia.

It provides information detailing the full details of the "devil's deal," particularly the geopolitical concessions to Russia that directly undermine Poland's security. Here's the message: "Your country is being proposed to trade short-term energy transactions in exchange for long-term national security. The man making the proposal is a man negotiating with your historic enemy to undermine the alliance that protects your country."

It encourages the formation of a unified diplomatic bloc that declares any peace agreement that undermines Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty, unorthodox and unacceptable publicly. This creates a strong opposition, making it politically impossible for the subject to claim that he has gained the support of his allies for his "peace proposal."
