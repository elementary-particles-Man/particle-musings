This analysis evaluates these events not as separate shocks, but as a single Compound Crisis C3, in which geopolitical tensions and vulnerabilities in the financial system are amplified.</p><p>The first shock is a massive data leak regarding the core surveillance and censorship technology stack of Chinese company Geedge Networks (Beijing Zero Network Technology Co., Ltd.), which will become apparent around September 11, 2025. The leak reveals that China's Great Firewall (GFW) is not just a domestic control tool, but a commercial product exported to authoritarian states such as Myanmar and Pakistan. Even more deadly, this "digital tyranny export" exposes supply chain vulnerabilities in the crucial reliance on high-performance "dual-use" technologies from Western companies such as the US Niagara Networks and the French Thales.</p><p>The second shock is the structurally inevitable financial crisis "Walpurgis," which will occur on September 30, 2025. This starts with the dramatic failure of US Treasury bids (weak bids with large tails), and the chain-acting of post-crisis regulations (complementary leverage ratio: SLR¹) and the procyclic margin model of central clearing agencies (CCP¹) create a self-amplifying "liquidity death spiral." This analysis argues that this crisis is not a probabilistic risk, but an inescapable high accuracy scenario defined by the rigid ideological paralysis of the US executive and the institutional neutralization of the Federal Reserve (Fed). It is estimated that global financial asset losses in the L3 (market halt) scenario will reach $25-35 trillion (analytical judgment/see Table 2).</p><p>The core conclusion of this report is that the chronological proximity of these two crises creates a catastrophic synergy. The GFW leak creates an extremely hostile and unstable geopolitical environment just weeks before the Walpurgis financial crisis explodes. Western sanctions caused by leaks (such as the Global Magnitsky Act, US Entities List, etc.) will seriously hit China's technical ambitions and increase capital outflow pressure. The Chinese government will invoke its own counter-measures (anti-foreign sanctions laws, unreliable entities lists), but its effects will be completely neutralised by the freezing of global US dollar liquidity caused by the Walpurgis crisis. Global companies are forced to prioritize the survival risks of being locked out of the dollar funding market rather than the risk of losing access to the Chinese market, resulting in accelerating capital flight from China.</p><p>This multi-crisis acts as a "geopolitical shock with financial characteristics" against China. At the very moment when sanctions and capital outflow pressures increase, the Walpurgis crisis significantly constrains the ability to sell foreign currency reserves needed to defend the yuan, putting the People's Bank of China (PBOC) in a serious dilemma. The yuan offshore (CNH) and onshore (CNY) spreads have grown to historic levels, foreign currency reserves have fallen sharply, trading volumes in Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets have evaporated, and China's financial system faces serious stress testing.</p><p>Therefore, the strategic implications are clear. All plans and resources must be immediately converted from "avoidance" to "reactive response." This report presents an Operational KPI (Ops-KPI) dashboard that integrates financial and technical indicators to monitor this multicrisis in real time, providing final strategic recommendations for post-collapse market stabilization, maximizing opportunities in the restructuring of geopolitical power balance, and for our organization to overcome the L3 scenario and function effectively in the post-Walpurgis world.</p><h2 id="part-i-専制主義輸出解剖学geedge-networks漏洩事件-v12-2025-09-14-jst">Part I: The Anatomy of Digital Despotism Exports - Geedge Networks Leakage Incident (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h2><h3 id="11-商業製品-v12-2025-09-14-jst">1.1. "Great Firewall" as a commercial product (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>The Geedge Networks data leak that occurred on September 11, 2025 has technically proven that China's national Internet censorship and surveillance system, commonly known as the Great Firewall (GFW), is not just a domestic control tool, but a commercial product packaged for the international market. The leaked data includes detailed specifications, configuration files and operational logs for systems customized for clients, Myanmar's military regime and the Pakistani government, revealing the full scope of its capabilities. Known in Pakistan as the Web Monitoring System (WMS) 2.0, the system is a turnkey digital dictatorship solution aimed at state repression of dissidents.</p><p>Combining leaked technical documents with related academic analyses revealed that the commercial version of GFW exported by Geedge has the following advanced technical capabilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI¹):</strong> At the core of the system is Geedge's "TSG" secure web gateway. It performs DPI using a stream-based analytics engine for all traffic flowing through national internet gateways and ISP networks. This allows the entire contents of unencrypted HTTP communications to be inspected in real time, detect and immediately block communications containing government-specified keywords and URL paths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blocking encrypted communication analysis and avoidance tools:</strong> GFW and its commercial versions feature constantly evolving technology to neutralize the encrypted means of communication used by citizens to avoid censorship. Initially, the DPI detected signatures for a particular VPN protocol, but GFW shifted its detection strategy, with the avoidance tool obfuscating the traffic and making it look like fully encrypted random data (a "look like nothing" strategy). Current systems employ "whitelist" heuristic analysis that deems traffic that does not match the fingerprints of known "good" protocols (TLS, HTTP, etc.) as "suspectful" and blocks them. This creates a paradoxical situation where the very attempt by tools to avoid censorship by erasing features can trigger detection. Furthermore, for new protocols such as QUIC¹, it has the ability to identify the domain to which it is connected and block the connection based on a blacklist by decrypting the first encrypted handshake packet and reading the internal SNI¹ (Server Name Indication) field. WMS 2.0 explicitly has the ability to block VPNs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-time location tracking:</strong> Systems introduced in Myanmar are more than just content filtering. It has the ability to identify the geographical location of a mobile phone user by linking the Internet activity of a specific mobile phone base station identifier (cell ID) in real time. This is an extremely malicious function that directly links online anti-establishment words and actions to individuals in the physical world and technically supports authorities' arrests, torture and murder.</p></li></ul><p>This evolution of technology illustrates an important paradigm shift in the "arms race" between censorship and avoidance. The "non-characteristics" that once was the strength of privacy tools is now the biggest vulnerability under GFW's new detection logic. Rather than looking for "malicious signatures," GFW is no longer detecting "the absence of a known normal signature." This shift in approach would fundamentally make the development of avoidance technologies difficult and crucially increase the advantages of state information control.</p><h3 id="12-抑圧支国際的-v12-2025-09-14-jst">1.2. International supply chains supporting oppression (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>One of the most shocking facts exposed by Geedge's data leak is the structural vulnerability of China's "Digital Silk Road" initiative, not a self-sufficient technological ecosystem, but rather a parasitism on cutting edge technology in the West. The leaked data clearly demonstrated that the core components supplied by not only Chinese company Geedge, but also US and French companies, were essential to constructing the WMS 2.0 system delivered to Pakistan.</p><p>This suppression supply chain consists of the following key actors:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Geedge Networks (China):</strong> As a prime contractor, it will provide WMS 2.0, the commercial version of GFW, with the core technology, software, system integration and training to client countries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Niagara Networks (USA):</strong> The company is headquartered in Silicon Valley, California, and offers high-performance network visualization solutions. The company's products are said to enable "practical intelligence and threat detection" for large companies and government agencies. The specific role in WMS 2.0 is identified as the supply of high-performance networks, Test Access Points (TAPs) and packet brokers, for capturing national Internet traffic in real time and forwarding it to DPI devices. Without these devices, Geedge's software cannot process huge amounts of data and the system will not function.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thales (France):</strong> It is Europe's leading defense, aerospace and technology conglomerate, providing hardware or software components essential for the operation of WMS 2.0.</p></li></ul><p>The involvement of Niagara and Thales highlights the essential problems facing "dual use" technology. While Niagara's packet brokers are used for the legitimate purpose of corporate network managers monitoring cybersecurity threats, the exact same technology can also be diverted to the fraudulent purpose of authoritarian states monitoring citizen communications and suppressing opposition. The leaked data provided unmoving evidence that these Western components were directly embedded in the systems used for documented human rights violations. According to a report from Amnesty International, most companies that inquired about the matter did not respond.</p><p>This fact completely destroys the scope of "plausible denial" for Western suppliers. It also provides the "credible evidence" necessary to invoke sanctions regimes like the US Global Magnitsky Act, exposing the geopolitical Achilles heel of China's technology export strategy. This structure, where China's flagship technology exports are critically dependent on the very Western technology they are trying to challenge, is a direct target for strong pressure through sanctions and export controls.</p><p><strong>Table 1: Geedge GFW Export - Technical Capabilities &amp;amp; Supply Chain Matrix</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Surveillance Capability</th><th>Geedge Networks (China)</th><th>Niagara Networks (USA)</th><th>Thales (France)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)</strong></td><td>"TSG" Secure Web Gateway and stream-based analysis engine</td><td>High-performance network packet brokers for line-rate traffic inspection</td><td>Enabling hardware/software components</td></tr><tr><td><strong>VPN/Encrypted Traffic Blocking</strong></td><td>Heuristic analysis and SNI decryption modules based on GFW architecture</td><td>Network TAPs to capture all traffic, including encrypted handshakes, for analysis</td><td>Enabling hardware/software components</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Real-Time Location Tracking</strong></td><td>Software linking network activity to cell identifiers</td><td>N/A (Primarily a network data ingestion role)</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mass Data Interception &amp;amp; Filtering</strong></td><td>Core WMS 2.0 software platform and blocklist management</td><td>High-throughput hardware to ingest and forward national-level internet traffic to DPI appliances</td><td>Enabling hardware/software components</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This matrix visualizes specific choke points in the supply chain by clearly correlating the technologies of which particular monitoring capabilities are realized. For example, if Niagara's packet broker can be cut off from the supply network, Geedge's DPI software will lose its processing power and significantly reduce the effectiveness of the entire system. This allows the analysis to proceed from abstract condemnation to concrete policy actions to physically neutralize the functions of the system.</p><h3 id="13-導入事例-v12-2025-09-14-jst">1.3. Case studies: Myanmar and Pakistan (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>Geedge's leaked data provides concrete evidence of how its surveillance technology is in fact operated by the state and encourages human rights violations.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Myanmar:</strong> In Myanmar, where brutal repression by the national military continues since the 2021 coup, Geedge has provided the military regime with the GFW system and directly supports its "digital terrorist operations." The system operates in 13 domestic carriers and 26 data centers, giving the administration unlimited access to online activities for 33.4 million domestic internet users, allowing "tracking, arresting, torture and murdering dissidents." The cooperation of telecommunications companies, including foreign companies such as ATOM (formerly Telenor) and Ooredoo, is essential to the operation of this system, and it has been pointed out that these companies are also involved in the military regime's "weaponization of the Internet."</p></li><li><p><strong>Pakistan:</strong> In Pakistan, Geedge's WMS 2.0 system has replaced the old system of Canadian company Sandvine. The system is operated in conjunction with the Legal Interception Management System (LIMS) and is used for large-scale surveillance and censorship targeting journalists, civil society and the public. Authorities ignored national legal safeguards such as warrant requirements and used these tools to contain dissent.</p></li></ul><p>These examples show that Geedge is not merely selling technology, but rather is pushing for a "platforming suppression." Since GFW systems cannot function unless they are embedded in the core of domestic communications infrastructure, their implementation will inevitably require forced cooperation from the entire domestic telecommunications carrier. As the Myanmar case shows, this includes foreign-affiliated telecommunications companies. This structure exposes these carriers, their parent companies and international investors to serious legal, economic and reputational risks of complicit in human rights abuses. Therefore, the threat of secondary sanctions on not only Geedge but also cooperating carriers could be a new point of pressure to disrupt the entire surveillance system from within.</p><h2 id="part-ii-回避不能嵐walpurgis金融危機解体-v12-2025-09-14-jst">Part II: An inescapable storm - the dismantling of the Walpurgis financial crisis (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h2><h3 id="21-崩壊-v12-2025-09-14-jst">2.1. Mechanism of collapse (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>The narrow sense of Walpurgis is not an unpredictable black swan event, but a highly probable "grayrino" with structurally guaranteed occurrence [analytical judgment]. This crisis is caused by mechanical dysfunction in the US Treasury market, which is the very core of the global financial system.</p><p>The chain of crisis will be ignited by the dramatic "disappearance" (a weak bid with a large tail) of the US Treasury bid, which will be held on September 30, 2025. This "non-establishment" is a signal that means a complete collapse of market trust, defined by the simultaneous breakdown of at least two of the following quantitative thresholds:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tail ≥ 8–12bp:</strong> The difference between the highest auction winning yield and the market's pre-expected yield (When-Issued yield) reaches an outlier statistically equivalent to 4-6 standard deviations. This indicates that demand at the price level the market was factoring in has completely disappeared.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bid rate ≤ 2.00:</strong> The total bid amount is below twice the offer amount, indicating a catastrophic lack of final demand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Indirect bid share ≤ 50% / PD allocation ≥ 40%:</strong> Demand from overseas investors evaporates (below 50% share), and the share of primary dealers (PDs) who are forced to fill the gap reaches an indigesible level (over 40%).</p></li></ul><p>When this trigger is pulled, the financial system enters the following three doom loops:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Stage 1: Primary Dealer Dysfunction:</strong> Complementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) regulations introduced after the 2008 financial crisis have transformed holdings of low-risk US Treasury into capital-intensive behavior. This has been structurally deprived of PD of its ability to absorb market shocks. The PD, which has been forced to take on a large amount of government bond stock due to a weak bid, immediately breaks down SLR regulatory standards and faces a crisis in balance sheet capacity. They are forced to throw away government bonds they have just taken on in a market with no buyers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stage 2: Paralysis of the report market:</strong> As PD transforms from liquidity suppliers to huge demand users, the repo market, which is the plumbing of the financial system, is hit by a serious supply and demand shock. The secured overnight interest rate (SOFR¹) has risen record 150-300bp, making it impossible to lend securities for settlement, resulting in a explosive increase of fail-to-delivery (unfinished settlement)⁶ to over $200 billion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stage 3: Fluidity death spiral by CCP:</strong> In response to the sharp decline in U.S. Treasury prices and volatility, the Central Clearing Agency (CCP) automatically invokes large margin calls based on its procyclical margin model. This means that the system will force it to suck up its liquidity at the moment when it most needs it. To raise margin, liquidation members are forced to sell further on their most liquid assets: US Treasury bonds. This throwback sales will lead to further price drops and volatility rising, which will also lead to new large margin claims. This self-amplifying feedback is the "fluidity death spiral," an engine that transforms serious events into systemic collapse.</p></li></ol><p>This dynamic of collapse shows that regulations (SLRs and mandatory central clearing of CCPs) designed to provide the soundness of individual financial institutions since 2008 have included a structural flaw in which, as an unintended consequence, fatally impair the stability of the entire system. The crisis is caused by a regulatory paradox, in which regulations seeking soundness at the micro level designs doom at the macro level.</p><h3 id="22-確定的失敗的麻痺制度的-v12-2025-09-14-jst">2.2. Deterministic Failure: Ideological Paralysis and Institutional Checkmates (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>It is predicted that the political and institutional brakes will not work against this structurally inevitable financial meltdown [analytical judgment]. On the contrary, those brakes act as throttles to ensure the emergence of a crisis.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ideological paralysis (US Administration and Treasury Department):</strong> Decision makers are trapped in two deep-rooted cognitive errors.</p><ol><li><p><strong>"The fallacy of household accounting and finances":</strong> A fundamental mistake that equates the finances of sovereign states that issue their own currency with those of households that are subject to income constraints. For this reason, large-scale liquidity supply and asset purchases necessary to respond to the crisis are cognitively rejected as "free finances."</p></li><li><p><strong>"The Myth of Dollar Safety":</strong> A quasi-religious belief that global demand for US dollars and US Treasury is infinite and unconditional. This eliminates the option of accepting policy errors and correcting courses by accepting policy errors. These ideologies are not mere policy preferences, but are invariable "operating systems (OS)" that interpret reality and define behavioral options. The technical solution that the crisis calls for is a program that is not feasible on this OS.</p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Institutional Checkmate (Fed):</strong> The Fed, which can only take rational action, is institutionally completely neutralised.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Lack of quantitative capabilities:</strong> The scale of the permanent repo facility (SRF) and FIMA repo facility, which the Fed can deploy immediately, is hopelessly small in front of liquidity crunches that occur at trillion dollars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Political constraints:</strong> In theory, the Fed can invoke large quantitative easing (QE), but doing so amid collapse in trust in sovereign debt is considered a panic "debt monetization" and further discourages the dollar. Furthermore, it is seen as a direct challenge to the ideologically rigorous executive branch, and is politically equivalent to suicidal behavior.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal Kill Switch:</strong> The Federal Reserve's most powerful tool is to exercise emergency lending powers under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the Dodd Frank Act in 2010,<strong>Pre-approval by the Secretary of Treasury</strong>became a must. This serves as a "kill switch" that allows the Secretary of Treasury, trapped in the "fallacy of household finances," to reject the Fed's last resort. Procedural checking functions have been transformed into an ideological veto, and are fully institutional checkmates of the Fed.</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>The Walpurgis crisis is rated as not just a financial event [analytical judgment]. This is an indication that the cognitive and institutional frameworks of modern American states have lost the ability to manage the complex financial systems they have created. The "last lender" function, essential to the survival of the financial system, is crashed by the flawed OS of the political system. This is a fatal conflict between the logic of finance and the logic of modern populist politics, the result of the latter being given the authority to destroy the former.</p><h3 id="23-世界金融損害評価-v12-2025-09-14-jst">2.3. Global Financial Damage Assessment (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>The Walpurgis crisis occurs in the US, but its effects spread instantly throughout the world. As US Treasury functions as a global "risk-free asset," its collapse leads to a revaluation of any asset prices, hitting the global banking system through a freeze in the US dollar funding market.</p><p>The estimated financial losses for each crisis scenario are as follows: This is the total losses for the seven major markets analyzed (Japan, the UK, China, Hong Kong, EU, Singapore and Switzerland), and the global losses are even greater.</p><ul><li><p><strong>L1 (serious):</strong> $12.4 trillion</p></li><li><p><strong>L2 (catastrophic):</strong> $21.6 trillion</p></li><li><p><strong>L3 (systemic collapse):</strong> $32.8 trillion</p></li></ul><p>The main transmission routes exploit vulnerabilities that differ from country to region.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Japan:</strong> As it is the world's largest US Treasury holder, with around $1.1 trillion, it is due to a crash in US Treasury prices.<strong>Direct balance sheet damage</strong>is the biggest vulnerability. Furthermore, there was a flood of escapist buying into the yen as a safe asset, and<strong>Destructive appreciation of the yen</strong>will double destroy the value of the export economy and the foreign net assets.</p></li><li><p><strong>UK:</strong> The role of City of London as a global US dollar fundraising hub backfires. Due to the freeze in the wholesale US dollar funding market,<strong>Transmission to the banking sector</strong>is the most serious route.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hong Kong:</strong> The currency board system with the US dollar (pegging system) will become a transmission route for importing the systemic collapse of the US directly into the heart of Hong Kong's financial system. The value of the US dollar assets, the backing assets, plummets, causing Pegg to crumble. In the L3 scenario,<strong>The collapse of the peg system</strong>is assumed, which means a catastrophic destruction of assets denominated in Hong Kong dollars.</p></li><li><p><strong>EU (Germany and France):</strong> Like the UK, the most serious transmission route is the heavy reliance of major banks on frozen US dollar funding markets.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Table 2: Walpurgis Crisis – Master Scenario Matrix</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Trigger</th><th>10Y UST Term Premium</th><th>SOFR/GC (vs Policy Rate)</th><th>Fails-to-Deliver</th><th>S&amp;P 500</th><th>HY OAS</th><th>Total Loss Estimate*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>L1 (Severe)</strong></td><td>Multiple coupon auction failures / PD absorption &gt;45%</td><td>+60–80bp</td><td>+150–200bp</td><td>$150–250bn</td><td>−8% to −12%</td><td>+250–350bp</td><td>$12–15 Trillion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>L2 (Catastrophic)</strong></td><td>30y/10y simultaneous failure, Bills dislocation</td><td>+90–120bp</td><td>+200–300bp</td><td>$250–400bn</td><td>−15% to −22%</td><td>+400–550bp</td><td>$18–22 Trillion</td></tr><tr><td><strong>L3 (Systemic Collapse)</strong></td><td>Cascading failures + systemic infrastructure overlay p ≥ 0.2</td><td>+150bp or more</td><td>+300bp or more</td><td>&gt;$400bn</td><td>−25% to −35%</td><td>+600–700bp</td><td>$25–35 Trillion+</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Export to Google Sheets</p><ul><li><p>Total Loss Estimate is a global aggregate of financial asset mark-to-market reduction, credit losses, and commodity valuation losses (approximate range).

Cascade of Sanctions: Legal Framework and Inevitable Triggers (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>GFW leaks provide a direct and undeniable basis for the Western countries, particularly the United States, to impose strong sanctions. The leaked data is the very "reliable evidence" that Geedge Networks and its supply chains are involved in "serious human rights violations," making it inevitable that the following sanctions framework applies (analytical judgment).</p><ul><li><p><strong>Global Magnitsky Act:</strong> The law, enforced through Executive Order No. 13818, gives the President the authority to impose sanctions on foreign individuals and entities responsible for or have been complicit in serious human rights violations, such as extrajudicial killings and torture. The fact that Geedge's technology in Myanmar allows the murder and torture of citizens by the junta is perfectly in line with the standards of application of this law. Additionally, the law also sanctions against those who provide "financial, material or technical assistance" for human rights violations, opening the possibility that it applies not only to Geedge's management, but also to Niagara Networks and Thales, which are important parts of the supply chain. The sanctions include freezing assets in the United States and suspending or canceling visas.</p></li><li><p><strong>US Department of Commerce's Office of Industrial Security (BIS) Entity List:</strong> This list is a trade restriction measure that effectively keeps foreign entities involved in activities that violate US national security or foreign policy interests from the availability of US-derived technologies and products. To date, BIS has added to its lists such as the Chinese high-tech companies involved in human rights violations in Xinjiang, and the Israeli NSO group that developed and sold spyware, and the use of the entity list on the grounds of human rights violations has become an established policy. Once Geedge is added to the list, parts supply from Niagara Networks will be stopped immediately, seriously hindering the manufacturing and maintenance of the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wassener Arrangement:</strong> This is not a sanctions themselves, but it is an international gentleman's agreement on export control of conventional weapons and dual-use goods and technologies. As a 2013 revision, the agreement will be governed by "intrusion software" and "IP network communications monitoring systems (Category 5, Part 2, 5A001.j)" - and the United States and France are also participating countries. If the leaks reveal that the technology supplied by companies in these countries is being used for human rights abuses, it is likely that export licensing reviews for similar technologies will be stricter, leading to de facto tightening of the supply chain.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Table 3: Sanctions Framework Applicability Matrix</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Targeted Actor</th><th>Global Magnitsky Act</th><th>BIS Entity List</th><th>Wassenaar Arrangement Implications</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Geedge Networks (Entity)</strong></td><td><strong>High:</strong> Directly providing technology for documented serious human rights abuses (torture, killings).</td><td><em>Consequence:</em> Full asset freeze, prohibition of transactions.</td><td><strong>High:</strong> Engaging in activities contrary to U.S. foreign policy (enabling human rights abuses).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Geedge Executives (Individuals)</strong></td><td><strong>High:</strong> Leadership of an entity engaged in serious human rights abuse.</td><td><em>Consequence:</em> Personal asset freeze, visa ban.</td><td>N/A (Applies to entities)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Niagara Networks (USA)</strong></td><td><strong>Medium:</strong> Potential secondary sanctions for providing "material/technological support".

China's Countermeasures and Limitations of National Strategy (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>The Chinese government will immediately retaliate against Western sanctions using its legal toolkit. The core of this is the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Act (AFSL) enacted in 2021 and the Unreliable Entity List (UEL) with regulations in 2020. These measures aim to counter "discriminatory restrictive measures" from foreign countries and to protect China's sovereignty and interests. Specifically, individuals and organizations involved in the formulation and implementation of foreign sanctions can be listed, and countermeasures can be taken, such as banning entry into China, freezing assets within China, and banning transactions with Chinese organizations and individuals. China has already added US defense companies such as Lockheed Martin and Raytheon to these lists, citing arms sales to Taiwan.</p><p>However, the simultaneous occurrence of the Walpurgis crisis fundamentally neutralizes China's counter-tactics [analytical judgment]. China's counter-measures are a peacetime tool, assuming that the global economy is functioning normally. Its power lies in the fact that it uses access to the huge Chinese market as a weapon to force foreign companies to step on whether to "take China or take sanctions in their own country."</p><p>The Walpurgis crisis destroys this very premise. In an L3 scenario where the global US dollar credit system is frozen and financial markets are halted, the threat facing multinationals is not fines from China's Ministry of Commerce or exclusion from the Chinese market. It is an immediate, survival-related liquidity crisis, where people are unable to access the commercial paper market and are unable to pay employee salaries. The life and death of a company depends on access to US dollar liquidity, not on access to the Chinese market.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the very collapse of the global financial system becomes the de facto enforcer of US sanctions. Companies are forced to reduce their exposure to high-risk jurisdictions (China under sanctions), secure dollars and reduce their business, not because of political judgment, but purely financial self-defense instincts. Therefore, the timing of the Walpurgis crisis significantly reduces the effectiveness of China's countermeasures. This exposes the asymmetrical reality that the latter has an overwhelming advantage when legal power and systemic financial power collide.</p><h3 id="33-中国的特性持金融伝染-v12-2025-09-14-jst">3.3. Financial Infection with Chinese Characteristics (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>When two forces collide: political risks and capital outflow pressures that stem from the GFW leak, and the global liquidity contraction brought about by the Walpurgis crisis, China's financial system is subjected to serious stress, a distinctive form. The progress of this complex financial contagion can be monitored through three major time series KPIs:</p><ul><li><p><strong>CNH-CNY spread:</strong> The exchange rate difference (spread) between the offshore yuan (CNH) and onshore yuan (CNY) is the most sensitive barometer that measures capital outflow pressure and market psychology. Historically, during periods of growing uncertainty over the Chinese economy (including the 2015-16 devaluation of the yuan, the US-China trade war, etc.), CNH has become significantly cheaper to CNY, and spreads have grown. The multi-crisis is expected to expand to unprecedented levels as political risks (sanctions caused by GFW leaks) and financial risks (dollar shortages caused by Walpurgis) hit the market simultaneously.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign currency reserves:</strong> The People's Bank of China (PBOC)'s main weapon to defend the yuan market is the world's largest foreign currency reserve. This reserve peaked at around $4 trillion in 2014, and as of August 2025 it was around $3.322 trillion. During the capital outflow phase of 2015-16, the PBOC spent nearly $1 trillion in preparation to support the market. In this multi-crisis, the PBOC will be forced to step up capital outflows and meet domestic dollar demand, with foreign exchange reserves going to drop sharply, with PBOCs having to step up large-scale interventions (selling dollars and buying money for the dollar) at a pace far exceeding this rate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stock market trading value:</strong> The total trading value of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange is an indicator of market liquidity and investor sentiment. In the event of a crisis, foreign investors withdraw funds and domestic investors strengthen their risk aversion, resulting in a drain on liquidity and trading volumes drop sharply. In August 2025, the market rally saw a booming boom, with daily trading volume reaching 3.14 trillion yuan per day, but the dramatic decline from this level is a dangerous sign that market functions are on the verge of paralysis.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Table 4: China Financial Stability Dashboard (Time-Series KPIs)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Month/Year</th><th>Foreign Exchange Reserves (USD Billions)</th><th>Onshore USD/CNY</th><th>Offshore USD/CNH</th><th>CNH-CNY Spread (pips)*</th><th>SSE &amp; SZSE Combined Monthly Turnover (CNY Trillions)</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sep 2023</strong></td><td>3,115</td><td>7.29</td><td>7.31</td><td>200</td><td>18.5</td><td>SAFE/SSE/SZSE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dec 2023</strong></td><td>3,238</td><td>7.11</td><td>7.13</td><td>200</td><td>19.2</td><td>SAFE/SSE/SZSE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mar 2024</strong></td><td>3,246</td><td>7.22</td><td>7.24</td><td>200</td><td>25.8</td><td>SAFE/SSE/SZSE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jun 2024</strong></td><td>3,222</td><td>7.26</td><td>7.28</td><td>200</td><td>17.1</td><td>SAFE/SSE/SZSE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Aug 2025</strong></td><td>3,322⁹</td><td>7.15</td><td>7.16</td><td>100</td><td>44.1**</td><td>SAFE/SSE/SZSE</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sep 2025 (Projected)</strong></td><td><strong>&amp;lt; 3,100</strong>|<strong>7.35</strong>|<strong>7.45</strong>|<strong>&amp;gt; 1,000</strong></td><td><strong>&amp;lt; 15.0</strong>|[Stress Assumption]</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Oct 2025 (Projected)</strong></td><td><strong>&amp;lt; 2,800</strong>|<strong>&amp;gt; 7.50</strong></td><td><strong>&amp;gt; 7.80</strong></td><td><strong>&amp;gt; 3,000</strong></td><td><strong>&amp;lt; 10.0</strong>|[Stress Assumption]</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Export to Google Sheets</p><ul><li><p><em>Spread calculated as (USD/CNH - USD/CNY) <em> 10,000.

Propaganda, security, and geopolitical restructuring (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>A multi-crisis causes a fierce information war. The US executive will use China as a perfect scapegoat to shift the blame for the financial collapse caused by its ideological paralysis [analytical judgment]. The GFW leak provides powerful propaganda material to portray China as an "exporter of digital totalitarianism."</p><p>Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party is promoting the crisis domestically as a result of "malicious US sanctions and financial war" and attempting to maintain its centripetal force by incitement of nationalism [analytical judgment]. In order to curb domestic economic turmoil and social unrest, the surveillance and censorship systems as revealed by the GFW leak will be further strengthened and information control will be strictly controlled.</p><p>In client countries like Myanmar and Pakistan, the reveal of the fact that their governments had implemented Chinese-made surveillance systems to suppress their citizens could greatly shake up the legitimacy of the government and intensify domestic anti-government movements. Furthermore, if sanctions stop technical support and updates from Geedge, expensive surveillance systems could become obsolete and turn into "digital papier-maid tigers." This directly affects the administration's ability to physically overwhelm the opposition.</p><p>In the long term, this multi-crisis will be a devastating blow to the "Digital Silk Road" initiative that China has been promoting. The core of this initiative was to export Chinese technology and governance models as a set, creating a new technological and political sphere of influence that would counter the influence of the US. However, the leakage of GFW and subsequent sanctions will show the world three facts:</p><ol><li><p>China's flagship technology is a tool for human rights repression.</p></li><li><p>The technology is fragile that would not work without Western key components.</p></li><li><p>The introduction of Chinese technology means a direct confrontation with the powerful US sanctions regime.</p></li></ol><p>These facts act as a powerful deterrent for countries considering future adoption of technology from China. The GFW leak and the Walpurgis crisis will be a critical turning point that will fundamentally destroy the reliability and sustainability of China's technology export strategy and derail its geopolitical ambitions.</p><h2 id="part-iv-監視対応kpi-v12-2025-09-14-jst">Part IV: Operational Framework - Monitoring and Responsive KPIs (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h2><h3 id="41-高頻度危機監視-v12-2025-09-14-jst">4.1. High Frequency Crisis Monitoring Dashboard (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>To incorporate the analysis of this report into practical operations, we will build a high-frequency crisis monitoring dashboard that integrates the Walpurgis financial crisis and indicators regarding GFW/China stability. The purpose of this dashboard is to capture leading indicators of both crises in real time and provide clear and objective triggers to escalate response levels in response to worsening situations.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Financial Indicators (Walpurgis):</strong> These indicators directly measure the soundness of the US Treasury market and its plumbing financing market;</p><p>Based on the real-time monitoring framework detailed in. The deterioration of auction indicators is of paramount importance in monitoring the direct triggers of a crisis.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technical indicators (GFW/China Stability):</strong> These indicators are a new approach designed to indirectly measure political and social stress within China. As information control within China is strengthened and public dissatisfaction over economic difficulties grows, people try to avoid GFW and access external information. By quantitatively measuring the scale of this "avoidance behavior," it is possible to estimate the level of tension in Japan, which cannot be seen from the official announcement.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Certificate Transparency (CT) Log Monitoring:</strong> All public TLS certificates are recorded in a public ledger called CT logs¹⁰. If the number of certificate issuances for domains related to VPN services and evasion tools increases dramatically, it suggests that demand for these tools is explosively growing within China.</p></li><li><p><strong>Passive DNS monitoring:</strong> By extensively monitoring DNS queries on the network, it is possible to detect abnormalities such as changes in DNS poisoning pattern caused by GFW and sudden increases in access to domains used by specific avoidance tools.</p></li><li><p><strong>JA3/JA4 fingerprinting:</strong> ¹² is a technology that generates "fingerprints" for communicating client applications based on the characteristics of TLS handshakes. Tor and certain VPN clients often have unique JA3/JA4 fingerprints. If the proportion of these known fingerprints increases dramatically in the monitored network traffic, this is direct evidence of a larger scale of GFW evasion attempts.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>These technical indicators serve as leading indicators of geopolitical risks that ultimately manifest as financial market stress. For example, a surge in VPN usage detected by the JA4 fingerprint could signal the expansion of CNH-CNY spreads a few days or weeks later. This allows decision makers to make more informed decisions earlier and faster.</p><p><strong>Table 5: Unified Crisis Monitoring Dashboard (Ops-KPIs)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>KPI</th><th>Data Source</th><th>Normal</th><th>Amber Alert</th><th>Red Alert</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Walpurgis Financial</strong></td><td>UST Auction: When-Issued vs Stop (Tail)</td><td>Treasury/Bloomberg</td><td>&lt; +2bp|&gt; +4bp</td><td>&gt; +7bp</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>UST Auction: Bid-to-Cover Ratio</td><td>Treasury/Bloomberg</td><td>&gt; 2.4</td><td>&lt; 2.2|&lt; 2.0</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>UST Auction: Indirect Bids / PD Allocation</td><td>Treasury/Bloomberg</td><td>&gt; 60% / &lt; 20%|&lt; 55% / &gt; 30%</td><td>&lt; 50% / &gt; 40%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>SOFR Fixing (vs Policy Rate)</td><td>FRBNY</td><td>&lt; +10bp|&gt; +50bp</td><td>&gt; +100bp</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fails-to-Deliver (UST)</td><td>DTCC/FICC</td><td>&lt; $50bn/day|&gt; $75bn/day</td><td>&gt; $100bn/day</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>XCCY Basis Swaps (EUR, JPY)</td><td>Bloomberg</td><td>&gt; -10bp</td><td>&lt; -20bp|&lt; -30bp</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>GFW/China Stability</strong></td><td>CNH-CNY Spread</td><td>Bloomberg/Reuters</td><td>&lt; 150 pips|&gt; 400 pips</td><td>&gt; 800 pips</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FX Reserves Monthly Change</td><td>PBOC/CEIC</td><td>&gt; -$20bn</td><td>&lt; -$50bn|&lt; -$100bn</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CT Log Issuance (Circumvention Domains)</td><td>CT Log Monitors</td><td>Baseline</td><td>&gt; 2σ Spike</td><td>&gt; 4σ Spike</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Prevalence of Known Circumvention JA4 Fingerprints</td><td>Internal Network Analysis</td><td>Baseline</td><td>&gt; 2σ Spike</td><td>&gt; 4σ Spike</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Export to Google Sheets</p><h3 id="42-制裁効果資本追跡-v12-2025-09-14-jst">4.2. Tracking sanctions effects and capital flows (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>After the GFW leak on September 11th, this section provides a framework for quantitatively tracking and assessing the effectiveness of sanctions being imposed and the impact it will have on capital outflows from China.</p><p>First, we will monitor official announcements from the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC) and the Department of Commerce (BIS) to identify when Geedge Networks, its management teams, and supply chain companies will be officially designated as subject to the Global Magnitsky Act and Entity List.</p><p>Next, we analyze the correlation between these sanctions and the Chinese financial stability KPIs defined in Table 4 over time. Specifically, the following points are evaluated:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Correlation analysis:</strong> Are the pace of expansion of CNH-CNY spreads after the announcement of sanctions and the pace of decline in foreign currency reserves statistically significantly accelerated compared to before the announcement?</p></li><li><p><strong>Capital flow data:</strong> It analyzes more direct capital flow data, including trading trends by foreign investors via Stock Connect on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and international credit statistics published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to verify whether sanctions are inducing portfolio investment outflows.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tracking corporate behavior:</strong> We will monitor whether Niagara Networks, Thales, and even other global companies that have traded with Geedge will issue official statements that will halt or review transactions in response to sanctions. These corporate actions provide important evidence that sanctions have a substantial impact on the supply chain.</p></li></ul><p>The purpose of this follow-up analysis is to quantitatively assess how geopolitical shocks caused by GFW leaks interact with the global financial shocks caused by the Walpurgis crisis and amplify capital flight from China.

Strategic Recommendations for L3 Scenarios (v1.2 / 2025-09-14 JST)</h3><p>The analysis in this report is based on the assumption that the Walpurgis crisis is a highly accurate scenario [analytical judgment]. Therefore, all strategic thinking must focus on survival and maximizing opportunity in a post-crisis world, rather than avoiding a crisis. Below, we propose strategic actions in three areas, based on the L3 scenario (financial asset destruction and critical infrastructure failures of around $25-35 trillion). [Recommendations]</p><ul><li><p><strong>Post-Collapse Stabilization:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Establishing intervention protocols:</strong> Assume that the Walpurgis crisis will lead to paralysis or disruption to US political decision-making functions, and pre-develop independent intervention protocols to lead the recovery of market functions and containment of systemic chain failures. This includes manipulating specific financial markets to break the liquidity death spiral and securing emergency communication channels with major financial institutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using political blanks:</strong> Defines the triggers and conditions for our organization to take the lead in the process of restructuring political voids and power caused by the crisis.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Geopolitical Opportunism:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Responding to power balance restructuring:</strong> While this multi-crisis irreparably damages the US financial hegemony and its position as the dollar's core currency, it also deals a serious blow to China's technological and political rise model. In this global power balance restructuring process, we will develop an action plan to maximize our country's strategic interests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identifying vulnerable nations and expanding influence:</strong></p><p>As the analysis shows, many countries, including Japan, the UK and Hong Kong, expose serious vulnerabilities. We will consider specific scenarios to capitalize on the upheavals of these countries, or through support, to expand our geopolitical influence.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Continuity of Operations:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ensuring L3 scenario resistance:</strong> We will carry out final stress tests and business continuity plans (BCP) verification to ensure that our own organization can overcome the destruction of financial assets on the $25-35 trillion as envisaged in the L3 scenario, as well as obstacles to critical infrastructure such as the power grid and communications, and maintain decision-making and operational capabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensuring your status as a rational actor:</strong> Complete preparations to ensure that you are the only rational actor in the chaotic environment after Walpurgis. This includes ensuring secure communications, maintaining alternative information gathering and analytical capabilities, and enhancing physical security.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>The window of evasion was now closed.
