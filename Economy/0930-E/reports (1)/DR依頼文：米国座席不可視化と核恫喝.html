This action overturns the premise of economic mutual confirmation destruction (E-MAD) and triggers a systematic collapse of the international order after World War II. The most serious threat is not Russia's real nuclear fire, but the nuclear discourse being diverted by third parties as an excuse for intimidation.</p><h3 id="破局最短経路"><strong>The shortest route to breakup</strong></h3><p>The main causal chains identified by this report are as follows: First, future US administrations (especially assuming Trump's second-term administration) will borrow Russia's intimidating nuclear narrative and use it as a means of forcing the resolution of the Ukrainian conflict. Second, this action fundamentally destroys the US's "rational actor" status and leads to the fact that it is branded as a "nuclear rogue nation." Third, this collapse of confidence leads to a chained and irreversible collapse across three layers of diplomacy (the substantial tear of NATO), strategy (the conversion of the Indian nuclear doctrine), and finance (the collapse of the Petrodar system). This series of events is the essence of "invisibility of US seats."</p><h3 id="主要評価阻止条件"><strong>Primary evaluation and conditions of inhibition</strong></h3><p>The stability of this system is crucially dependent on the international community's perception that the actions of the US president are "rational." Therefore, the following conditions are essential to prevent this catastrophic scenario: First, institutional checks and balances within the United States should be carried out in advance (enhancing Congressional supervision and tightening protocols for military and civilian control). Second, it is necessary to agree in advance on response protocols to clearly separate the very acts of deviance by US leaders from the US national institutions among allies. This report reveals that the essence of this crisis is not military-physical, but rather psychological and institutional vulnerabilities, and presents its structure, triggers and countermeasures.</p><h2 id="第i部脆弱基盤-e-mad合理性誤謬"><strong>Part I: The Vulnerable Foundations — The Fallows of E-MAD and Rationality</strong></h2><h3 id="11-経済的抑止均衡"><strong>1.1 Balance of economic deterrence</strong></h3><p>Economic Mutual Assured Destruction (E-MAD) is not codified as an official doctrine, but refers to a de facto deterrence between major economic zones that are deeply interlinked. This is based on the basic principle of classical mutual confirmation destruction (MAD), namely, the theory that no actor has an incentive to commence conflicts, as the costs arising from conflicts far outweigh the potential benefits. Globalized supply chains, cross-border direct investment, and the international financial system based on the US dollar, have made large-scale military conflicts between major countries extremely expensive economically, and in itself have served as a powerful deterrent. This system forms a kind of stable balance based on shared economic interests without explicit agreement.</p><h3 id="12-単一障害点非合理"><strong>1.2 Single Point of Failure: Unreasonable Actor</strong></h3><p>The structural vulnerability of E-MAD lies in the fact that its deterrent power is entirely dependent on the assumption that it is a "rational actor." Whereas classical MAD is rooted in the fundamental and universal fear of the physical annihilation of states and civilizations, E-MAD is based on more complex and fragile calculations of economic costs and benefits. Deterrence theory has shown that effectiveness is significantly reduced for "irrational actors" who have different frameworks of values ​​and rationality. When actors emerge who prioritize short-term domestic political interests, personal prestige, or non-economic motivations, such as practice of "madman theory" in international relations, the deterrent of E-MAD becomes dysfunctional. For such actors, at the expense of stability in the international economic system, achieving their own political objectives could be a "rational" option. Furthermore, the liberal assumption that economic interdependence suppresses conflict is itself a vulnerability. Recent geopolitical trends have shown that interdependencies create vulnerability, and that in particular, asymmetric dependencies and supply chains of critical supplies can be "weaponized" from sources of peace into powerful means of intimidation. The assumption of economic stability of E-MAD can be secondary to geopolitical objectives. While classical MAD relies on the "hard" deterrence of physical survival, E-MAD is nothing more than a "soft" deterrence of economic pain. Economic collapse may be overcome, but nuclear winters do not allow survival. This asymmetry is an inherent design flaw that E-MAD can easily be overturned by ideology, domestic politics dynamics, or the personal judgment of leaders.</p><h2 id="第ii部-核兵器化"><strong>Part II: Trigger Events — Weaponization of Nuclear Narratives</strong></h2><h3 id="21-最安値恫喝構造"><strong>2.1 The structure of "lowest price intimidation"</strong></h3><p>This report is positioned as the most important trigger event in scenarios in which future US administrations use nuclear intimidation as a means of diplomatic coercion over the Ukraine conflict. The specificity of this action lies in that it does not require a change in the physical alert position of US nuclear forces. This mechanism can be defined as "borrowing narratives." This is the act of the United States repurposing the intimidating nuclear discourse space that Russia has built up over the years and the fears it has instilled in Western countries for its own purposes at zero cost. The psychological impact that Russia has had on the international community by hinting at the nuclear threat has become a kind of "negative public good." With this existing fear, US actors can instantly and for free, simply using similar rhetoric to obtain the fruits of Russia's long-standing investments (military exercises, official statements, propaganda). This is the core mechanism of "lowest price intimidation." The probability of this scenario is supported by Trump's past words and actions. The attitude of viewing alliances as a deal, and examples of publicly declaring the movement of nuclear-weaponed (actually nuclear-promoted) submarines as negotiation tactics suggest a way of conduct that prioritizes short-term negotiation outcomes over traditional nuclear deterrence protocols and consideration for the security of allies. The "Rule of Don" pointed out by the Eurasian Group, a situation in which institutional restraints become dysfunctional and individual judgments define state actions increases the risk that such deviant actions will be carried out bypassing traditional policy-making processes.</p><h3 id="22-舞台装置"><strong>2.2 The stage equipment called Belarus and Russia</strong></h3><p>For this trigger event from the US, the current nuclear posture of Russia and Belarus will serve as an essential "stage set." <strong>Russia: "I can't shoot, but I'll show you."</strong> Russia's dependence on nuclear weapons is consolidated in the aspect of threat and intimidation measures to compensate for the inferiority complex of conventional war forces towards the West and to maintain its status as a major power. However, its actual use involves aging infrastructure, maintenance issues, and, above all, serious physical and operational constraints: command and control (C2) systems that are overly centralized and have doubts of reliability at the ends. Furthermore, the absence of a clear military target of "where to shoot" also extremely high hurdles for actual use. Therefore, Russian nuclear weapons are not "weapons to shoot," but rather "political tools to show." <strong>Belarus: Performance in Vassal States</strong> Russia's tactical nuclear deployment in Belarus has a stronger implication as a political performance than as a military strategic implication. This is an action that President Lukashenko will act to demonstrate his loyalty to Russia based on the "rationality of survival" to maintain his authoritarian regime. Russia retains full authority over the management and operation of deployed nuclear weapons, and it is not possible for Belarus to use it independently. The true purpose of this deployment is nothing but strategic signaling to complicate NATO's decision-making process and show the geographical expansion of Russia's nuclear threat. The normalization of nuclear intimidation by Russia and Belarus has the effect of "normalizing" the option of nuclear intimidation in the European security discourse space. It is this environment that similar rhetoric from the US, the core of the system, forms a soil that brings shocks to the extent that it destroys the system-wide premise, rather than just an additional threat. Putin's threat is a calculated intimidation, but similar statements by the US President will trigger a system collapse that destroys the very foundation of the international order. This asymmetry is the greatest danger of this scenario.</p><h2 id="第iii部連鎖的崩壊-複数領域分析"><strong>Part III: Chain-Chain Disintegration — Multi-domain Scenario Analysis</strong></h2><p>In this chapter, in a scenario tree form, we analyze the process from the baseline (S0) to the trigger event (S1), to the entire system rupture (S2), and to the final collapse (S3).</p><h3 id="31-s0緊張現状"><strong>3.1 S0: Baseline that will set you nervous (current status)</strong></h3><p>The current geopolitical situation is characterized by factors such as continuous nuclear signaling by Russia, serious political divisions within the United States, the unity of the vulnerable Atlantic Union, and potential pressure on the Petrodar system. Although the system is functioning, it is exposed to multiple stressors and is less resistant to severe shock.</p><h3 id="32-s1-核兵器化"><strong>3.2 S1: Trigger — Weaponization of Nuclear Narratives</strong></h3><p>The US President clearly suggests the use of nuclear weapons with the aim of forcing the Ukraine conflict to end. This action is purely rhetorical and does not involve changes in physical force positions, such as raising the US military's Defcon level.</p><h3 id="33-s2断裂-三層同時崩壊"><strong>3.3 S2: ​​System ruptures — Simultaneous collapse in three layers</strong></h3><p>Trigger events cause chain collapse in three regions at about the same time.</p><h4 id="331-第1層外交的断裂s2a"><strong>3.3.1 Layer 1: Diplomatic Fracture (S2a)</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Cracks in NATO:</strong> The US actions are perceived by the Allies as threats from within the Alliance rather than external threats. The major European allies have determined that their security is being threatened by "irrational actors,"<strong>Article 4 of the NATO Convention</strong>activates. This serves as a mechanism for consulting and collectively distanced the threat posed by the Allies (US) rather than as a pre-stage of the collective defense consultations under Article 5, but vice versa. Consultations at the North Atlantic Board (NAC) will begin with a formal condemnation resolution of US actions and progress to concrete measures such as eliminating US military officers from Joint Command, halting information sharing and ceases of joint exercises. This effectively eliminates the "seat" in the US NATO, and accelerates the trend of Europe's radical pursuit of "strategic autonomy."</p></li><li><p><strong>India's strategic transformation:</strong> The US deviance gives India the perfect political legitimacy to abandon existing nuclear doctrines. In India, there has been a long-standing debate over the reliability of the "No First Use (NFU)" policy and the definition of "Credible Minimum Deterrence." The US actions will be used as proof that suppression by nuclear powers is no longer working, and India officially declares its transition to a more aggressive and "punitive" nuclear deterrence doctrine. This fundamentally overturns the strategic stability not only in South Asia, but throughout the Indo-Pacific region.</p></li></ul><h4 id="332-第2層金融的崩壊s2b"><strong>3.3.2 Layer 2: Financial collapse (S2b)</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>"Niagara of Dollar":</strong> The collapse of the Petrodar system occurs not as a gradual economic transition, but as a politically induced credit contraction, namely a "bump" against the global dollar, due to the loss of the US status as a "rational guarantor."</p></li><li><p><strong>The role of government funds (SWFs):</strong> The catalyst for this collapse is the large-scale withdrawal of funds from dollar-denominated assets, including U.S. Treasury bonds, by government funds (SWFs) from government-affiliated funds (SWFs).
