     Chapter 1: Bankruptcy status in Europe: normalization or a systemic crisis?
    </h2>
    <p>
     The European corporate sector is at a critical crossroads. The surge in the absolute number of corporate bankruptcies has made headlines and has fueled concerns about the imminent systemic crisis of "Bankruptcy Dominoes." However, when detailed data is analyzed, more complex and nuanced situations emerge. It is more accurate to characterize current trends as a process of inevitable "normalization" and market adjustment from the unusual support measures of the pandemic era, rather than an uncontrolled contagion. This diagnostic distinction is extremely important. This is because appropriate policy responses to coordination are fundamentally different to what is needed to deal with systemic collapse. Therefore, any "straight measures" must be formulated based on this fundamental perception of reality.
    </p>
    <h3 id="11-倒産説解体">
     1.1 Dismantling the "Bankruptcy Domino" theory
    </h3>
    <p>
     Surface data certainly shows a concern. In 2024, the absolute number of corporate bankruptcies across Western Europe recorded a significant double-digit increase. Germany saw a 22.5% increase, Greece increased 42.5%, and Ireland increased 32.0%, with a significant increase in France as well. Specifically, the cumulative number of bankruptcies in France over the past 12 months up to August 2024 reached 62,893, an increase of 23.8% from the same period last year. These numbers are the main drivers of the perception of the "bankruptcy dominoes."
    </p>
    <p>
     However, this perspective is lacking in context and incomplete. It is essential to position these numbers within a historical context. For example, France's 2023 bankruptcies (55,492) remained below the 59,342 average of 2010-2019 before the pandemic. This suggests a "catch-up" from a period when bankruptcies were artificially restrained due to large-scale state support. Even the 62,893 figure in August 2024 is only 6% above the pre-pandemic average. What's more, it is important to take into account the fact that the total number of French companies has increased by around 40% over the last decade. It is natural that if the number of companies increases, the absolute number of bankruptcies will also increase.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more essential indicator is not absolute numbers but bankruptcy "rate". A detailed study conducted by the National Bank of Austria (OeNB) between 2019 and 2025 provides definitive suggestions on this point. The survey found that despite post-pandemic normalization and a significant increase in corporate population, the unweighted bankruptcy rate has remained stable at around 1% of the corporate population. This finding raises fundamental questions about the "domino" theory. More importantly, the bankruptcy rate will be even lower when weighted by economic importance. In 2023, the asset-weighted bankruptcy rate was 0.58% and the employment-weighted bankruptcy rate was 0.75%. This indicates that many bankrupt companies are small businesses with relatively little impact on the economy as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     This deviation between absolute numbers and weighting rates is the most important point that policymakers should grasp. Acting on only concerning absolute numbers and determining policies without understanding the stable proportions behind them is costly, unnecessary, and risks leading to market-distorting interventions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="12-地域的国家的差異">
     1.2 Differences between regions and countries
    </h3>
    <p>
     The concept of the "bankruptcy domino effect" suggests a contagious collapse that spreads across borders. However, the data shows that the situation in Europe is extremely diverse and not uniform. In 2024, the number of bankruptcies actually fell in Denmark and the UK. In the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region, the total number of bankruptcies fell by 9% in 2024, which is heavily distorted by the normalization caused by special factors in Hungary. Countries like Latvia (+24.6%) and Estonia (+10.2%) saw a sharp increase, while Bulgaria and Slovakia fell. Italy's 2023 bankruptcy levels remain low compared to pre-pandemic, with generous government support and the introduction of new laws that promote reconstruction outside of court.
    </p>
    <p>
     This heterogeneity is shaped by the regulatory environment of each country, the specific content of pandemic support measures, and various economic situations. This fact strongly suggests that a uniform "stripe" that can be applied to Europe as a whole is inappropriate. Rather, a tailor-made approach based on detailed analysis of each country is essential.
    </p>
    <h3 id="13-大企業倒産増加">
     1.3 Increase in bankruptcies of large companies
    </h3>
    <p>
     Although the overall bankruptcy "rate" is stable, an increase in bankruptcies of large companies is a concern that cannot be overlooked. In 2024, 474 large companies went bankrupt worldwide, with Western Europe becoming one of the main reasons for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     This trend clearly shows where the true risk of transmission lies. While the overall economy is in a healthy adjustment process, the collapse of large corporations, a small number of key nodes in the economic network, carries a disproportionate risk of causing genuine contagion through the supply chain. Thousands of small-scale micro-business bankruptcies have limited macroeconomic impacts, but the collapse of a single large manufacturer or retailer can cause a credit shock to hundreds of healthy small-business suppliers and service providers that rely on them, leading to a chain of defaults. This is the most reliable route for the "domino effect" and any risk mitigation strategy should focus on this.
    </p>
    <p>
     The table below summarizes the current state and outlook for corporate bankruptcies in major European countries. Differences in situations between countries and inconsistencies in forecasts by major credit insurers highlight how uncertain the current environment is.

     Chapter 2 Macro Finance Pressure Cooker: Main Factors of Corporate Parliament
    </h2>
    <p>
     Following Chapter 1, we have an overview of what is happening in bankruptcy, and this chapter will analyze the "why." The current difficulties facing European companies are "snap-off" where two forces - sluggish demand and high costs - are simultaneously acting. Understanding this structure is essential to developing effective policy responses.
    </p>
    <h3 id="21-成長低迷需要弱">
     2.1 Slow growth and weak demand
    </h3>
    <p>
     The economic recovery in Europe is slow and there is a high degree of uncertainty about the future. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts the eurozone's growth rate in 2025 to just 0.8%, indicating that it will recover to 1.2% in 2026. BusinessEurope, a European economic organization, has also revised its EU growth forecast for 2025 down to 1%. The situation in Germany is particularly severe, with the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation (DIHK) predicting that the economy will shrink by 0.5% in 2025, facing a crisis for the third consecutive year.
    </p>
    <p>
     This macroeconomic stagnation directly impacts corporate sales. The sluggish consumer and corporate business sentiment has curtailed spending and investment, creating a tough business environment, particularly for the B2C sector, such as retail and hospitality, and for the B2B services, which rely on corporate capital investments. With the pie of demand itself shrinking, companies are forced to compete for survival.
    </p>
    <h3 id="22-金融引締資金調達環境">
     2.2 Monetary tightening and the funding environment
    </h3>
    <p>
     The interest rate hikes implemented by the European Central Bank (ECB) from 2023 to 2024 to curb inflation have significantly increased the costs of companies raising funds. According to the ECB's Bank Lending Survey (BLS) in the second quarter of 2025, interest rates are on a downward trend, but banks have generally remained unchanged for corporate loans, and have tightened the credit standards for small and medium-sized businesses. The reason for this is that banks are increasing concern about the economic risks faced by their customers. Corporate capital needs overall remain weak.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means double difficulties for businesses. First, the burden of repayment of existing floating interest rate obligations increases, putting pressure on profits. Second, funding for new investments becomes more difficult and expensive, and hindering growth. According to estimates from credit insurance company Allianz Trade, if credit provisions fall by 1%, bankruptcies will increase by about 0.4% in Germany and about 2% in France within three months. The combination of weak demand and tighter trust is a typical pattern of putting a company in a difficult situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     This situation represents a regime shift (regime shift) from the era of "cheap funds" in the 2010s. Companies that have built business models based on the premise of low interest rates and expanding credit are now fundamentally difficult to survive. The current increase in bankruptcy is partly an essential structural adjustment to the new macroeconomic reality of positive real interest rates. A policy that does not recognize this regime change and simply seeks to bail out businesses that have fallen into financial trouble due to rising interest rates is an attempt to resist structural economic trends, leading to misallocation of resources and delaying the inevitable adjustments, resulting in more "zombie companies."
    </p>
    <h3 id="23-根強圧力別脆弱性">
     2.3 Intense cost pressures and sector-specific vulnerabilities
    </h3>
    <p>
     The main sectors face pressure that could be called "toxic mix." The Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) report highlights specific challenges. The transportation sector is suffering from a double woes of declining industrial demand and rising fuel and toll costs. Manufacturing is suffering from high input costs and supply chain disruption. And the construction industry is struggling with high interest rates and declining investments. These trends are similar in Western Europe, with the biggest increase in bankruptcies in 2024 being construction, transportation and B2B services. In France, transportation (+44.8% of the average pre-pandemic) and real estate (+24.6% of the same) have been hit in particular seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are not merely cyclical pressures. Changes in regulations such as CO2-related truck tolls will result in permanent costs. Although energy prices have fallen from peak times, they continue to be a factor that reduces the competitiveness of European industry compared to their US competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, the fact that predicaments are concentrated in specific sectors suggests that sector-specific solutions are needed rather than broad macroeconomic stimulus packages. For example, if it is deemed that the construction sector's plight poses a systemic risk, targeted measures could be taken, such as strengthening support for energy-efficient renovation projects rather than providing uniform loans to all construction companies. General stimulus packages cannot address fundamental issues such as CO2 tolls that the transportation sector faces. Policy should be as precise as surgical.
    </p>
    <h2 id="第3章-忍寄外部脅威地政学貿易倒産加速">
     Chapter 3: Ceremonious External Threats: Geopolitics and Trade Accelerate Bankruptcy
    </h2>
    <p>
     This chapter shifts the focus from domestic factors to serious and highly uncertain external risks. We argue that even if the current trend of bankruptcy is within the scope of "normalization," large-scale external shocks, especially in the event of a trade war, could turn into a full-scale systemic crisis.

     3.1 The Threat of Trade Wars: Quantifying Downside Risk
    </h3>
    <p>
     The possibility of a trade war between the US and the EU is recognized as the biggest upside risk in bankruptcy forecasts. Allianz Trade and Atradius present specific quantitative scenarios. If a "full trade war" breaks out, Allianz Trade's global bankruptcy forecast will worsen from +6% to +7.8% in 2025 and from +3% to +8.3% in 2026. This means that there will be another 9,100 corporate bankruptcies in Western Europe. In the Atradius downside scenario, the global bankruptcy rate for 2025 is projected to be +6% (vs. 0% baseline) and +5% for 2026 (vs. -5% baseline).
    </p>
    <p>
     This is not a negligible risk. High tariffs on major European exports such as automobiles and machinery will directly impact revenue and profitability in some of Europe's most important industries. The IMF points out that trade frictions have already "depressed domestic demand and export outlook."
    </p>
    <p>
     This situation means that economic sovereignty is fundamentally lost for European policymakers. The ability to manage the company's corporate sector has now become largely dependent not only on domestic policy instruments such as the ECB's interest rate policy, but also on external political events such as the US trade policy. "Aisa Strategy" focusing solely on domestic issues (such as credit support) could be completely neutralised by external trade shocks. Therefore, the focus of policy must shift to trade diplomacy and building corporate resilience against trade shocks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="32-毒素不確実性投資計画影響">
     3.2 Uncertainty as a toxin: Impact on investment and planning
    </h3>
    <p>
     More than the direct impact of tariffs, the "uncertainty" itself is causing damage to the economy. BusinessEurope notes that the "unpredictable nature of tariff announcements, threats and postponements" creates a difficult environment where "companies respond with expensive hedging strategies, investment deferrals, and shortened planning periods." A German DIHK survey cites "economic policy situation" as the biggest business risk by a record 60% of companies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Uncertainty paralyzes investment. When global trade rules are in liquidity, companies postpone large capital investments. This is directly fed back to the weakness of domestic demand identified in Chapter 2, creating a vicious cycle in which external threats amplify domestic weaknesses. The "uncertainty" mentioned by German companies is not a vague feeling. It is a hindrance to quantifiable investments that are already stifling growth even before any tariffs are in place. The threat is just as harmful as its execution. If this dark cloud of uncertainty is not dispelled, policies to promote investment (for example, tax credits) will not be effective. The "straight measures" that are most effective for corporate health may not be financial, but diplomatic, which restores predictability to trade relations between the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="33-脆弱性伝染">
     3.3 Supply Chain Vulnerabilities and Transmission
    </h3>
    <p>
     Geopolitical tensions and trade disruptions exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities. In 2024, more than 76% of European shippers experienced supply chain disruptions, causing one in three companies to have difficulty securing the materials needed for production.
    </p>
    <p>
     This directly links external threats with systemic contagion risks. Trade wars not only hurt exporters, but also cut off the flow of parts essential to domestic producers. The collapse of major suppliers due to trade shocks could halt production of far larger customers and propagate the shock throughout the system. This reinforces the point that the collapse of large internationally connected enterprises, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Section 1.3, is the most powerful pathway for the "domino effect."

     Chapter 4: The Legacy of COVID-19: Rewinding Support and the Conflicts of "Zombie Businesses"
    </h2>
    <p>
     This chapter critically evaluates support measures during the pandemic era and positions the current wave of bankruptcy increase as a direct and predictable outcome of those policies. Analyze the trade-offs between preventing short-term collapse and long-term costs such as moral hazard and misallocation of resources.
    </p>
    <h3 id="41-緊急支援成功規模">
     4.1 Success and scale of emergency assistance
    </h3>
    <p>
     European governments have implemented large-scale support measures. France's National Guaranteed Financing (PGE) programme has loaned approximately 145 billion euros to 700,000 companies, part of an emergency package totaling 470 billion euros. German short-time work system Kurzarbeit has been widely rated as preventing mass unemployment, and one study estimates it preventing a 3% point rise in unemployment. Italy has also provided extensive support, including a moratorium on loan repayments.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is clear that these measures have been undoubtedly successful in their primary purpose of preventing the devastating 2020-2021 windfall of liquidation and unemployment. The low number of bankruptcies during this period directly demonstrates its effectiveness.
    </p>
    <h3 id="42-意図結果債務過剰">
     4.2 Unintended consequences: excessive debt and moral hazard
    </h3>
    <p>
     However, this support came at a cost. In France, corporate leverage has increased significantly, with PGE loans adding to corporate debt to more than 7% of GDP. Although these loans were flexible, they remain liabilities on the corporate balance sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The widespread availability of guaranteed loans and grants creates moral hazard. In other words, the expectation that states will intervene to prevent collapse could lower the incentive for companies to carefully manage risk. This could lead to excessive risk taking in the future. The focus of the current debate is whether companies should have expected to prepare for a shock like the pandemic, and some say it would be reasonable to put aside the concerns of moral hazard in such extreme events.
    </p>
    <p>
     The design of COVID-19 support measures directly shapes the nature of the current bankruptcy crisis. Loan-based systems like PGE in France have created the problem of "overdebt" and employment retention systems like Kurzarbeit in Germany have created the problem of "labor force hanging up." Both have simply postponed rather than resolve the underlying economic shock. The current bankruptcy is the result of the burden of these specific policy choices being circulated. Providing further loans to companies already suffering from PGE debt would be counterproductive. The solution must match the specific nature of the problem (for example, debt restructuring for French companies, reeducation programs for German workers, etc.).
    </p>
    <h3 id="43-企業論争必要淘汰">
     4.3 "Zombie Company" Controversy: Is it necessary to quell?
    </h3>
    <p>
     An important concern is that the support was not fully selective and "continued to artificially make use of less-productive companies." This hinders the Schumpeterian "creative destruction" necessary for a healthy economy, namely the process by which resources are redistributed from failed companies to more innovative companies.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to an ECB paper, early support for 2020 was relatively well directed towards highly productive companies, but this association has weakened over time. However, it has also been shown that zombie companies were unlikely to receive support. While this suggests that the issue may not be as serious as it was concerned, the risk of misallocation of resources remains an important concern for policymakers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The current increase in bankruptcies can be seen as a delayed but necessary market "cutting" in which companies that were only viable through state support end up leaving the market. This process is painful, but is essential for long-term productivity growth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, the political success of COVID-19 relief measures has created dangerous precedents and "policy traps." Once successful at avoiding the crisis with large spending, there is a huge political pressure to do the same again, despite the fact that such interventions are now inappropriate. With the success of the 2020 bailout experience, economically sound debates against interventions such as moral hazard, zombie companies and fiscal costs are hard to accept politically. The biggest challenge for policymakers may be political rather than economic. That is to manage the expectations of the public and explain why the 2020 solution is wrong in 2025. The call for "squeezing measures" is likely to be a product of this political pressure. The main function of this report is to resist this pressure and provide an analytical basis for advocating for a more economically sound approach, even if it is more politically challenging.
    </p>
    <h2 id="第5章-政策介入評価枠組">
     Chapter 5: Framework for evaluating policy interventions
    </h2>
    <p>
     This chapter is the core analysis part of this report that directly responds to users' requests to evaluate the proposed "sewing measures." Rather than judging specific unknown policies, it provides a robust, principled framework based on the important trade-offs identified in previous analysis.
    </p>
    <h3 id="51-原則1処方箋前診断---流動性-vs-支払能力">
     5.1 Principle 1: Prescription diagnosis - Liquidity vs. Payment ability
    </h3>
    <p>
     Any "styling measures" must first accurately diagnose problems at the company level. Is the company facing a temporary liquidity shortage (a business that is viable but unable to make short-term payments) or is it insolvent (a liability exceeds assets and a business model no longer holds).
    </p>
    <p>
     Depending on this diagnosis, appropriate policies differ. Liquidity support (short-term financing, guarantees, etc.) is appropriate for the former. However, supplying liquidity to insolvency companies simply creates "zombies" and wastes valuable resources. A suitable policy for insolvency companies is to promote orderly exits and business restructuring (e.g., simplified bankruptcy proceedings). French PGE was originally a liquidity supply tool, but now it has become a solution challenge for many companies.
    </p>
    <h3 id="52-原則2的絞支援-vs-包括的支援---回避">
     5.2 Principle 2: Targeted Support vs. Comprehensive Support - Avoiding Moral Hazard
    </h3>
    <p>
     The COVID-19 experience highlighted the risks of broad and untargeted support. Comprehensive measures are inefficient, costly and create significant moral hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therefore, any new intervention must be targeted, like surgical procedures. This requires clear and objective standards. For example, support can be limited to companies that are considered systemically important because of their role in the critical supply chain (discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.3) or to companies in viable sectors that have been hit by certain, temporary shocks (such as sudden tariffs). The default position should be "no support", and intervention should be an exception that requires strong justification.
    </p>
    <h3 id="53-原則3短期的救済長期的健全性---創造的破壊">
     5.3 Principle 3: Balance between short-term relief and long-term health – Tradeoff between "creative destruction"
    </h3>
    <p>
     There is an inevitable trade-off between the short-term goals of employment and business maintenance, and the long-term need for productivity improvements, "creative disruption." Supporting a bankrupt company will prevent capital and labor from being redistributed to more productive and innovative companies, ultimately reducing the growth potential of the entire economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Policymakers must weigh the short-term social costs of bankruptcy (unemployment) versus the long-term economic costs of stagnation. A sound policy mix may provide strong support (e.g., enhanced unemployment benefits, reeducation programs for growth areas) to affected workers while allowing bankruptcy, and encourage them to move towards new, more productive jobs. This shifts the focus from saving businesses to saving workers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="54-原則4根本原因対処-vs-症状対処">
     5.4 Principle 4: Addressing the root cause vs. Addressing the symptoms
    </h3>
    <p>
     By definition, "straight measures" tend to address symptoms (such as lack of funds) rather than the underlying cause (incompetent business models, high energy costs, excessive regulation, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
     The proposed measures must be evaluated against this standard. Will the policy help businesses become viable in a new macroeconomic environment (discussed in Chapter 2) or simply postpone their bankruptcy? For example, loans do not solve the problems of carriers suffering from high CO2 tolls. A more effective but politically challenging policy could be to review their toll structure or to support investment in more efficient vehicles. This is the difference between symptomatic "styling measures" and true structural reforms.
    </p>
    <p>
     These four principles form a kind of "policy trilemma" for policy makers. In other words, it is impossible to achieve three things at the same time: (1) bailing out all businesses, (2) fostering long-term productivity, and (3) maintaining financial discipline and avoiding moral hazards. Any "shell" proposed represents the choice of which corner of this trilemma to sacrifice. This framework forces people to ask, "What are you prepared to sacrifice in order to implement this measure?" rather than asking, "Is this measure okay?" This redefines user challenges from technical evaluation to strategic policy decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, there is an overlooked but important constraint of the state's administrative capacity on its ability to implement effective and targeted policies. Even a theoretically perfect and highly targeted scheme is inferior to a simpler, slightly less targeted scheme that works if it cannot be managed effectively. There is a trade-off between policy accuracy and speed and feasibility of implementation.

     6.4 Final Outlook (2025-2026): Navigation of Uncertainty
    </h3>
    <p>
     Experts have divided views on the trends in Europe's bankruptcy after 2025. Allianz Trade predicts that bankruptcies will continue to rise in 2025 (+6%) and 2026 (+3%), citing delays in interest rate easing and increasing uncertainty. Meanwhile, Atradius is expected to stabilize in 2025 and decrease in 2026, as the economic situation improves.
    </p>
    <p>
     This difference in forecasts shows how uncertain the current economic environment is. The final path for European bankruptcy to follow from 2025 to 2026 is not yet decided. It will be shaped by the interaction of three factors: normalizing the ongoing post-pandemic, the effectiveness of domestic structural reforms, and, most critically, the consequences of global geopolitics and trade trends.
    </p>
    <p>
     In conclusion, short-term "seasoning" may be attractive, but a strategic focus on resilience, adaptation and competitiveness is the only sustainable path to advancement. Policy steering must be based on a determined determination to ensure long-term economic health without fearing short-term pain.
