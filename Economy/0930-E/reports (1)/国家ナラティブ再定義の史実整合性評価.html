     Strategic analysis of new national narratives on Japan, Italy, Germany and the UK

     executive summary
    </h2>
    <p>
     This report examines the validity of the new "national narrative" proposals formulated by the Ark-R Project on Japan, Italy, Germany and the UK from a multifaceted perspective. The analysis was conducted based on three key evaluation criteria: historical consistency, national acceptability, and strategic effectiveness. The national narrative assessment scores, key risks, and proposed revisions to reduce risk are summarized below.
    </p>
    <p>
     Germany's "responsible European leader" narrative cleverly integrates the acceptance of historical responsibility and the role of modern security, and is rated the most relevant of the four countries. It is highly consistent with historical facts, supported by a wide range of domestic consensus, and has extremely strategic effectiveness in fostering international trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast, both Japan's "global contributor" and the UK's "Global Britain: Modern History" received moderate ratings. Both countries have attempted to avoid historical controversy by focusing on positive aspects, which leads to ignore the serious "war on memory" within the country, significantly undermining national acceptance and strategic effectiveness in certain regions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Italian "reconciled heritage" narrative was the lowest rating. This narrative attempts to "reconciliation" by treating anti-fascism, the ideal of the Republic's founding, along with tragedy caused by the Fascist regime's war of aggression (such as the Foybe genocide), which distorts historical context, further exacerbate domestic political divisions, and erodes international trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     In conclusion, it has been revealed that effective national narratives depend on the ability to integrate the difficult past into modern national identity and responsibility rather than avoiding it. This report identifies the inherent risks facing national narratives and presents specific amendments to maximize their strategic value.

     Introduction: Strategic Essentials of National Narratives
    </h2>
    <p>
     In a time of rekindling of great power competition and information war, coherent and reliable national narratives are no longer cultural luxury, but an important tool for national strategy. National narrative is defined as a selective yet resonating story in which the nation speaks about itself in order to foster domestic unity and project a desirable identity to the international community. Its effectiveness cannot be guaranteed simply by emphasizing the positive aspects of its own country. Rather, the credibility and influence of history are determined by how it faces the complexity of history and the points of contention.
    </p>
    <p>
     This report analyzes and evaluates national narrative proposals formulated for the four countries, Japan, Italy, Germany and the UK, each at the heart of the historical turbulence of the 20th century and still play an important geopolitical role today. The following three criteria will be applied to the evaluation: First, is "historical consistency," that is, is the narrative based on verifiable historical facts? Second, "national acceptability," the possibility that narratives can gain widespread support from diverse political and social groups within the country. Third, it is the ability of narratives to form international awareness in a way that contributes to the national interests and to contribute to achieving diplomatic goals. Through this multifaceted examination, we evaluate the validity of each narrative and make recommendations to maximize its strategic value.
    </p>

    <h2 id="第1部-日本国家分析">
     Part 1: National Narrative Analysis of Japan
    </h2>
    <h3 id="11-地球規模貢献者">
     1.1. The narrative of "global contributors"
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative positions postwar Japan as a member of the peaceful and constructive international community. The central pillar of this is the Official Development Assistance (ODA) program, which began with postwar compensation and transformed into a huge engine in Asia's economic development. This story highlights Japan's role as a provider of quality infrastructure, a supporter of human security, and a trusted partner in global development. This aims to build national identity through positive contributions afterwards, rather than pre-1945 history.
    </p>
    <h3 id="12-史実整合性評価">
     1.2. Evaluation of historical consistency
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative is highly consistent in that it is based on vast and verifiable facts. Japan's ODA began in the 1950s as a reparation of wars to Myanmar, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. The initiative has since evolved into pure development assistance, with the cumulative aid amount of USD 514.3 billion up to 2019 on a total expenditure basis.
    </p>
    <p>
     The program's geographical focus is overwhelmingly in Asia, with 56% to 59% of bilateral ODAs in recent years being allocated to the region. Major aid recipients include China, which received a total of 3.66 trillion yen by 2022, Vietnam, which received a total of over 752 billion yen by 2000, and Indonesia.
    </p>
    <p>
     A notable feature of Japan's ODA is its focus on investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, railways and power plants. This accounts for 44.4% of Japan's ODA, a significantly higher percentage compared to other major donors. This investment has produced concrete results, including the construction of the Tomei Expressway through World Bank loans and the development of large-scale infrastructure in China and Vietnam.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, Japan's ODA has received positive international reviews. His contributions in the field of infrastructure development and human resource development in Bangladesh and Thailand are particularly highly appreciated. Japan's aid model also helped to broaden the circle of development cooperation, creating the opportunity for South Korea and Thailand to become donors themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, historical records are not uniformly positive. This narrative tends to omit criticism that ODA contracts are "tide assistance" that benefits Japanese companies, and the fact that ODA to China is not fully informed within China, causing increasing dissatisfaction within Japan. While these points slightly undermine the integrity of the narrative, the fact of its underlying contribution remains unshakable.
    </p>
    <h3 id="13-国民的受容性評価">
     1.3. Evaluation of national acceptability
    </h3>
    <p>
     The biggest barrier to widespread acceptance of this narrative within Japan is the issue surrounding the serious and unresolved conflict over Japan's historical perception, the so-called "Tokyo Trial View of History."
    </p>
    <p>
     At one pole of domestic political discourse, there is a strong demand for a more proud view of history, which views postwar history education and public debate as "vam-deprecating historical views" or "excessive atonement." This position is represented by critics like Sakurai Yoshiko and Hyakuta Naoki's work, "Nihon Kokuki." For them, narratives that speak only to postwar contributions may appear insufficient in obscuring Japan's prewar position.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the opposite end of this, there are people who want to be more thorough in remorse for prewar perpetrators, such as the Nanjing Incident and the "comfort women" issue. From this standpoint, narratives that focus solely on positive postwar aspects can be seen as intentional "escape" or historical revisionism from the negative aspects of history.
    </p>
    <p>
     This domestic division is institutionalized by the existence of "neighborhood countries clauses" in textbook certification. This clause calls for consideration in the treatment of modern and contemporary history with neighboring Asian countries such as China and South Korea, and has been criticized by some as a way of allowing interference in domestic affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, national sentiment complicates the acceptance of this narrative. Against the backdrop of territorial issues, many Japanese people have a negative impression of China, and the ongoing conflict makes it difficult to accept purely positive narratives that emphasize past contributions.
    </p>
    <h3 id="14-戦略的有効性評価">
     1.4. Assessing strategic effectiveness
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative is evaluated in two aspects. It has shown a certain level of effectiveness at a wide range of international communities. Japan is widely recognized as a major contributor to global development, and has received high praise for its "contribution to the world" in BBC opinion polls. In particular, in Southeast Asia, ODA has served as an important diplomatic tool to promote Japan's "free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)" concept and strengthen bilateral relations.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the effectiveness of this narrative is significantly reduced in the most geopolitical region of Northeast Asia. In China and South Korea, Japan's attitude of emphasizing postwar contributions without seriously facing historical issues before 1945 often leads to doubt that it is the "whitewashing" of history. The repeated debates over history textbooks are events that symbolize this dynamic.
    </p>
    <p>
     This situation poses the risk of a "third defeat in the information war," as some analysts point out. By failing to actively integrate difficult history into its own story and speak it independently, Japan allows other countries to spread negative narratives of "a nation without reflection." As a result, the goodwill and soft power built up through ODA are offset by this distrust surrounding historical perception and neutralised.
    </p>

       <strong>
        Validity score: 5.7/10
       </strong>
       (Historical Consistency: 8, National Acceptance: 4, Strategic Effectiveness: 5). Though this narrative is factual, it divides the country and strategically dysfunctional on the most important geopolitical stage.

     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Key risks:
       </strong>
       The biggest risk is that the narrative of "global contributors" is perceived as "narratives of escape from history" especially in Asia. If this perception becomes established, it will not only neutralize the soft power benefits of Japan's ODA, but it will also strengthen the image of a "state that is dishonest towards history" and will actively undermine its diplomatic stance.

          Transform into a narrative of "evolution" rather than "regeneration":
         </strong>
         The framework is shifted from a postwar story of complete "rebirth" to a story of "evolution" of the nation. This framework has led to Japan's commitment to postwar peace and development from the catastrophic failures of the Imperial era.

         <strong>
          Integrating ODA with historical liquidation:
         </strong>
         It presents ODA not merely as development aid, but as a multi-generational, concrete act of atonement that began with war reparations and evolved into a commitment to regional prosperity. This brings together "good deeds" and "bad deeds" as a story of coherent causality.

       <li>
        <p>

          Promoting collaborative history research:

         To mitigate strategic risks, in parallel with this narrative, we will launch a diplomatic initiative to fund and promote joint history research projects with researchers from China, South Korea and Southeast Asian countries. This focuses on both the effects of Japanese invasion and the ODA, and shows a commitment to multifaceted truth rather than a one-sided story.

     Part 2: National Narrative Analysis of Italy
    </h2>
    <h3 id="21-和解遺産">
     2.1. The narrative of "reconciled legacy"
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative aims to overcome historical divisions and create a unified Italian identity. The foundation of this is the universally praised ancient Roman heritage (
     <em>
      Romanness
     </em>
     ) and utilizes the world's leading cultural heritage. He then attempts to splice the conflicting experiences of the 20th century, such as the tragedy of fascism, the anti-fascist resistance movement, and the Foybe genocide, into a complex story that has overcome civil war and revived as a modern European republic.
    </p>
    <h3 id="22-史実整合性評価">
     2.2. Evaluation of historical consistency
    </h3>
    <p>
     The reliance on Roman heritage of this narrative has historically been a major issue. The fascist regime organized and broadly diverted the symbols of ancient Rome (fasquez, eagle, Roman salute) and myths, justifying its own imperialist ambitions and constructing a totalitarian identity. therefore,
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Romanness
     </em>
     Any attempt to use this as a symbol of modern unity must confront the fact that it has become a tool in the 20th century.
    </p>
    <p>
     The attempt to "reconcile" the conflicting trauma of the 20th century ignores irreconcilable historical facts. The Italian Republic was clearly established on the values ​​of the anti-fascist resistance that fought against the Mussolini regime and its Nazi allies. The Foybe genocide and the escape of the Istrian Dalmatians are a horrifying tragedy caused by Yugoslav partisans, which occurred in the context of a 20-year, brutal Italianization policy of a fascist regime and a harsh war of occupation in Yugoslavia. Presenting these events as morally equivalent or as tragedy unrelated to each other distorts historical causality.
    </p>

     The physical heritage of fascism in Italian architecture and urban planning cannot be denied, and presents a complex challenge. Although many buildings have been diverted and their political implications have been "empty" over time, debates over this "difficult heritage" continue to this day, and simple reconciliation is not permitted.

     2.3. Evaluation of national acceptability
    </h3>
    <p>
     The national acceptability of this narrative is extremely low due to the deep-rooted political divisions that are represented by two competing public holidays. "Liberation Day" (April 25th) is the Republic's National Founding Day, which celebrates the victory of the anti-fascist resistance movement. Meanwhile, the "Day of Memory" was established in 2004 (

    <p>
     <em>
      Day of memory
     </em>
     (February 10th) is a day to commemorate Foybe's tragedy and the resulting escape. In modern political debate, these two anniversaries are often treated confrontationally, appearing to be a "war of memories" rather than a "reconciliation."
    </p>
    <p>
     The current Meloni regime (led by the "Italian compatriots" with post-fascist roots) has upgraded the importance of "Memory Day," but often keeps it vague or minimal mention of the anti-fascist tradition on April 25th. Prime Minister Meloni's discourse about the "Day of Memory" emphasizes the "conspiracy of silence" and the fact that the victims were targeted "just because they were Italian," and places this as a purely nationalist tragedy. This approach is viewed by opposition parties and critical positions as a historical revisionism that treats fascist perpetrators and their victims on the same level.
    </p>
    <p>
     As evident from the new controversy of school textbooks, which have largely ignored the Foybe issue for decades, now, there is no national consensus on how to interpret this history. Any narrative attempting to reconcile will be immediately attacked by both sides, as "justifying fascism" by the left and as "inadequate perception of communist crimes" by the right.

     2.4. Assessing strategic effectiveness
    </h3>
    <p>
     Rather than projecting a united image of a nation, this narrative is likely to expose Italy's domestic conflict to the international community. Other countries will see Italy as a nation that cannot even agree on the values ​​of their own nation's founding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Narratives that appear to treat anti-fascist struggles and post-fascist elements on par with each other, or to underestimate the context of fascist invasion leading to the Foybe genocide, will be widely condemned internationally as historical revisionism. This significantly undermines Italy's soft power and position within the European Union (EU), which is built on a consensus of post-fascism and democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     In particular, Germany and other European partners have built their postwar identities on clear and unambiguous breaks with their totalitarian past. Italian narratives, which could be perceived by ambiguous attitudes towards fascism, will create diplomatic friction and undermine trust.

This should be at the heart of the narrative.

    </h2>
    <h3 id="31-責任欧州">
     3.1. Narrative of "Responsible European Leader"
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative presents Germany's leadership role in modern Europe not as a pursuit of power, but as an obligation arising from lessons learned from the devastating history of the 20th century. It is built on two pillars. First, there is a deep, institutionalized process that addresses the Nazi past (
     <em>
      Coping with the past
     </em>
     ) and this is now the core of national identity and the foundation of its reliability. Secondly, the recent "Zeitenwende" (
     <em>
      Tense
     </em>
     , a historical turning point), which positions Germany's increased defense spending and a new commitment to a leadership role in security as a necessary and responsible application of historical lessons to counter modern acts of aggression and to protect the European democratic order.
    </p>
    <h3 id="32-史実整合性評価">
     3.2. Evaluation of historical consistency
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative accurately reflects decades of, but constantly evolving processes. It began with the postwar deNaziation and the Nuremberg trials, but true social liquidation was slow. This process was advanced by domestic pressure, such as the student movement in 1968, and the 1970 Prime Minister Willie Blunt's knee-jerk apology in Warsaw (1970).
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

     ) was a symbolic action.
    </p>
    <p>
     This process eventually leads to a "culture of memory" (
     <em>
      Memory culture
     </em>
     ) was deeply institutionalized. German curriculum requires teaching about the Holocaust from an early age, and Nazi symbols are prohibited by law. Public memorial facilities such as Berlin's "Memorials for the Genocide of European Jews" have become a central feature of the cityscape. This shows the transition from a mere discourse of "atonement" to a permanent discourse of "responsibility."
    </p>
    <p>
     Prime Minister Olaf Scholz's speech on February 27, 2022, "Tseitenwende" was addressed to include security and economic interdependence with Russia (
     <em>
      Change through trade
     </em>
     It marked a truly dramatic disconnect from post-Cold War German foreign policy, which was based on the premise of "change through dialogue." The speech promised to establish a special military fund of 100 billion euros and achieve NATO's defense spending target of 2% of GDP. This is a historically accurate transformation. The strength of this narrative lies in that it positions this shift not as a denial of post-war pacifism, but as an inevitable evolution to protect the very values ​​adopted from reflection on the past.
    </p>
    <h3 id="33-国民的受容性評価">
     3.3. Evaluation of national acceptability
    </h3>
    <p>
     There is a strong and lasting consensus within Germany about the need to face the Nazi past. "Historian Controversy" (
     <em>
      Historian dispute
     </em>
     ) and although there are debates over the form of memory, and the existence of far-right forces, the core principle of responsibility is not seriously challenged in mainstream politics or society.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shock of Russia's invasion of Ukraine led to a tectonic movement in German public opinion. Policies such as large-scale military spending, which were previously unthinkable, and the provision of arms to conflict areas, have gained widespread support from the public. The 100 billion euro special fund was supported by 67% of German citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, while Zeitenwende's principles are accepted, political debate continues as to how they are implemented. There are concerns about bureaucratic barriers, delayed equipment procurement, and whether the government is able to turn its original momentum into a coherent long-term strategy. However, these do not question the rights and rights of policies, but rather debates on how to implement them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="34-戦略的有効性評価">
     3.4. Assessing strategic effectiveness
    </h3>
    <p>
     Germany's credibility as a peaceful, democratic, and reliable European partner is its sole and greatest diplomatic asset. This reliability is the process of facing the past (
     <em>
      Coping with the past
     </em>
     ) is almost entirely based on an international recognition of the sincerity of the ) . Without this, Germany's economic strength and calls for European integration would be viewed with doubt rather than trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     This reliability is the factor that justified and made possible Zeitenwende. The reason why German rearmament is not considered a threat by neighboring countries is that it is clearly positioned as a means of protecting European order by a nation that has proven what it has learned from its history of invasion over 75 years.
    </p>
    <p>
     This narrative allows Germany to demonstrate leadership in a way that is acceptable to its partner countries. By positioning their actions as "responsibility" rather than "ambition," we will reassure small and medium-sized EU and NATO members. Prime Minister Scholz's speech clearly positioned Germany as a "guarantor of European security," but it is because of its unique historical position that Germany can play this role.

         <strong>
          Maintaining narrative consistency:

         <strong>

     Part 4: National Narrative Analysis of the UK
    </h2>
    <h3 id="41-現代史">
     4.1. The narrative of "Global Britain: Modern History"
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative is an attempt to define post-Brexit identity. While acknowledging the historical existence of the British Empire, it quickly shifts its focus from there to a modern, future-oriented state. It highlights Britain's role in the development of parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, and global trade, depicting the Commonwealth as a voluntary family between nations. It also highlights its sustainable contribution to global security through NATO and soft power through culture and language. Imperial heritage is presented as a complex stage of history overcome by contemporary multicultural, globally involved identities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="42-史実整合性評価">
     4.2. Evaluation of historical consistency
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative attempt to treat the empire as a chapter in a closed history is historically inaccurate. The empire's legacy is a living reality that shapes modern Britain's demographic, institutions, economy, and an unresolved "culture war." Polls show that the public is deeply divided between those who feel proud of the empire (49% in one survey and 59% in another) and those who feel embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Important historical events such as the Balfour Declaration (1917) represent the complexity that this narrative seeks to flatten. The British document pledged to protect "civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities" while also pledging to protect "the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities." Its heritage is not just a simple historical fact, but a source of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and is the spark of intense international conflict, where the UK's historical role is central to its discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
     While selectively highlighting positive legacies such as parliamentary and the rule of law, the narrative downplays systemic violence, exploitation and racism that were at the heart of imperial rule. Such a one-sided presentation is a form of distortion of history.
    </p>
    <h3 id="43-国民的受容性評価">
     4.3. Evaluation of national acceptability
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative is positioned in the midst of a fierce domestic "cultural war" over history and identity. On one pole, there are people who are often associated with the political right and Brexit movements, relying on a powerful "nostalgic masternarrative" about empire and lost greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other pole is the movement led by younger generations, academic historians and minority communities to demand critical liquidation of racism and exploitation, the heritage of the imperial heritage. This can be seen in movements such as decolonization of the curriculum and the removal of the statue of Edward Colston.
    </p>
    <p>
     This conflict has been amplified by educational systems that have historically not taught the empire systematically and critically. For this reason, the public is susceptible to simplified, politically motivated narratives from both sides. A "moderate" narrative who tries to get somewhere between the two is likely to be attacked by both parties, either as a "woke (a conscious apology)" or as a "Jingoistic (a glamorous patriotism) glorification."
    </p>
    <h3 id="44-戦略的有効性評価">
     4.4. Assessing strategic effectiveness
    </h3>
    <p>
     This narrative is deeply connected to the "Global Britain" concept that underpinned Brexit. This concept was fueled by a nostalgic vision of Britain as a great, independent maritime trading nation that is not bound by Europe. This has affected some domestic voters, but it is a strategic problem.
    </p>
    <p>
     For many commonwealth countries and potential global partners, narratives that appear to underestimate the cruelty of empires create a sense of alienation. It could be perceived as arrogant and insensitive, and undermine Britain's efforts to build new partnerships. The debate over the possibility of a royal apology for colonialism highlights the sensitivity of the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
     The king, currently serving as Charles III, plays an important role as head of the Commonwealth. Although his role is primarily ritual, the King's individual commitment to environmental protection and inter-religious dialogue gives him a great soft power. However, he was known for his strong opinions during his time as Crown Prince, and continues to walk the "tightrobe" between ceremonial duties and skillful use of political influence. National narratives that are overly nostalgic or uncritical of the past can undermine the King's ability to function as a symbol of unity for the modern, diverse commonwealth.

          Transforming from "history" to "multiple histories":

         Attempts to create a single, monolithic story should be abandoned. Instead, the narrative is reconstructed around the concept of "Global History of the UK" (plural).

         This narrative needs to be supported by a reliable, long-term, national reflection process. The government should set up a well-known independent committee to review how the empire and its heritage are taught in schools. Its clear goal is to develop a critical, multifaceted, and fact-based curriculum. This action itself would be a powerful strategic communication that demonstrates that it is a mature nation facing its complex history.

     Conclusion: Comparative insights and strategic integration
    </h2>
    <p>
     Combining the findings from case studies from four countries reveals a significant contrast. While Germany has managed to integrate its difficult past into a powerful modern narrative, Japan, Italy and the UK are all struggling with serious domestic divisions over historical perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
     A common theme revealed from the analysis is that the inability to form a broad domestic consensus on the interpretation of the nation's most traumatic historical events is the greatest obstacle to building strategically effective national narratives. Narratives that try to ignore or cover up these "wars of memories" are destined to fail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Based on this analysis, the following strategic principles that the Ark-R project should consider in future narrative constructions are presented below.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Not evasion, but approval:
       </strong>
       Rather than ignoring difficult history, successful narratives incorporate and interpret it into their own story.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Rooted in the values ​​of nation-founding:
       </strong>
       Narratives must be rooted in the established constitutional values ​​of modern states (e.g., the anti-fascist constitution of Italy, the basic law of Germany).
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Rather than declaration, the process:
       </strong>
       Narratives are more than just slogans. It needs to be supported by a reliable, long-term process that demonstrates a sincere commitment to the narrative told, such as educational reform, public memorials and diplomatic initiatives.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        From one-sided memory to multifaceted memory:
       </strong>
       In an interconnected world, narratives that open and acknowledge dialogues to other countries' perspectives are more resilient and effective than narratives that stick to purely unilateral historical interpretations.
