     European Financial Shock: Comprehensive evaluation of delay in euro issuance and financial vulnerabilities of three major countries

     Chapter I: Crossroads: Stagnation, division, and geopolitical backwinds
    </h2>
    <p>
     The eurozone is at a critical crossroads due to structural weaknesses and external pressure. As the macroeconomic stagnation continues to last for a long time, the risk of financial division between member countries is once again manifested, and geopolitical uncertainty is cooling investor sentiment. This situation suggests that the crises of trust are quietly progressing through comparative analysis of market indicators and central bank response capabilities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="11-経済停滞罠">
     1.1 The trap of stagnation in the macroeconomics
    </h3>
    <p>
     The eurozone economy is falling into the trap of low growth. The latest economic forecasts from Eurosystem staff show that real GDP growth is expected to recover only an extremely gradual recovery, at 0.9% in 2025, 1.2% in 2026 and 1.3% in 2027. This contrasts with trends in the global economy, which are slowing down but more dynamic. Inflation is projected to return to its target of 2.0% in 2025 and 2027, but this is achieved in a low-growth environment without strong domestic demand, indicating the fundamental lack of vitality in the economy. This economic vulnerability means there is little cushioning for external shocks, making it a core vulnerability that significantly constrains member states' financial capabilities in response to crisis.
    </p>
    <h3 id="12-分断兆候国債市場認識">
     1.2 Signs of division: Government bond spreads and market recognition
    </h3>
    <p>
     The main indicator of financial division risk within the eurozone is the national government bond yield spreads against German government bonds (Bund). This directly reflects how the market values ​​the creditworthiness of each country. Looking at the 5-year credit default swap (CDS) spread, which further shows the market price of direct default risk, as of September 5, 2025, Italy (42.38 basis points) and France (38.61 basis points) have added significant premiums to "core" countries such as Germany (8.44 basis points) and the Netherlands (11.58 basis points), indicating that the market is taking into account clear risk disparities. The VSTOXX index, which can be considered the European version of the VIX index, is a barometer that measures the fear psychology of the market, and has skyrocketed during past crises. The level of the index as of 2025 is being closely monitored as an indication of the level of anxiety lurking in the market.

     1.3 Escape to safe assets: Record-breaking rise in gold prices as a vote of no confidence in fiat currency
    </h3>
    <p>
     The sudden rise in gold prices to an unprecedented level of over $3,500 per ounce in September 2025 is more serious than mere inflation hedge. The move is a sign of deep-rooted concern over the stability of the global financial system and the long-term viability of fiat currencies, including the dollar and the euro. Of particular significance is that the European Central Bank (ECB)'s own report pointed out that gold surpassed the euro in 2024, becoming the world's second largest central bank reserve asset, behind the dollar. This shows that the world's most conservative investors, the central bank, is actively replacing strategic assets from the euro to gold. This phenomenon does not simply mean a change in market sentiment, but a decline in structural confidence in the value storage function of the euro. The fact that central banks such as China, India, Turkey and Poland are increasing their holdings of US bonds and other sources due to concerns about US debt levels, geopolitical risks and trade frictions confirm this trend. It is a crucial signal that suggests that capital flight from the euro could become more intense in future systems crises than in past crises.
    </p>
    <h3 id="14-中央銀行ecb米国連邦準備制度理事会frb対比">
     1.4 Central Bank Dilemma: Contrast between the ECB and the Federal Reserve
    </h3>
    <p>
     Historically, the market has perceived the ECB's response to the crisis as slower and more reluctant than the Fed. During the global financial crisis, the Fed began preventive rate cuts in September 2007, while the ECB's first action was a rate hike in July 2008, and finally turned to a rate cut after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. This difference in response made a clear difference in the pace of economic recovery, with the US recovering pre-crisis GDP levels by the second half of 2011, while the eurozone reached the same level only in 2015. Even amid the COVID-19 crisis, the Fed deployed a wide range of innovative liquidity supply measures within weeks, acting at an unprecedented speed and scale. The ECB's response was also critical, but due to its governance structure and mandate constraints, the focus was on expanding asset purchases (PEPPs) and liquidity supply (TLTROs) rather than reducing policy rates, which were already in the negative zone. The Fed's experience shows that faster and larger deployment of non-traditional monetary policies such as Balance Sheet Policy (BSP) and Forward Guidance (FG) can be effective without the side effects that have been bothered. This historical contrast has deeply influenced the formation of market expectations. In other words, the market expects the Fed to act faster and more decisively than the ECB, and this "foresight gap" exists. As a result, capital is likely to move towards the US dollar, where more reliable and quick policy backstops are expected in the global risk-off phase. In addition to the vulnerability within the region, the euro will also face double vulnerability as its institutional pillar, the ECB, predicts that it will be slow to respond, resulting in an asymmetric risk structure that amplifies capital outflow during times of stress.

     Chapter II: The tension in Germany and France: Deep analysis of the vulnerability of core countries
    </h2>
    <p>
     We will dissect the economic and financial weaknesses of Germany and France, which were the cornerstones of traditional stability in the eurozone. This chapter discusses the historical roles of these two major countries are beginning to be reversed. Germany has shifted to fiscal expansion against the backdrop of economic weakness, while France is facing a serious sovereign crisis due to a lack of fiscal discipline and political paralysis.
    </p>
    <h3 id="21-財政派不本意支出国">
     2.1 Germany's paradigm shift: from fiscal hawks to unwilling spending countries
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Economic stagnation
     </strong>
     : The German economy, once a driving force behind the European economy, is in a "straint," and after shrinking for the second consecutive year in 2023 and 2024, it is expected that growth rate in 2025 will remain near zero. The forecasts from the European Commission, the German Federal Bank, the IMF and the IMF Institute for Economic Research are concentrated in the range of -0.0% to 0.2%, with a gradual recovery of around 1.0% in 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Weaknesses in construction
     </strong>
     : This stagnation is not merely a cyclical thing. This is due to deep-rooted issues such as a structural manufacturing crisis, a decline in exports to major markets like China, and the high uncertainty that curtails investment.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The major reform of the "debt brake"
     </strong>
     : Against this economic hardship and geopolitical pressures such as the Ukrainian War and US President Trump's re-election, Germany has decided to make a historic policy change. In March 2025, the bipartisan coalition of the Christian Democratic and Social Union (CDU/CSU), the Social Democrats (SPD), and the Green Party agreed to a major reform of the "debt brake" stipulated in the constitution. The move reflects the growing national consensus on the need for large-scale public investment.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Details of reform
     </strong>
     : The reforms exclude defense spending above 1% of GDP from the debt brake, which limits the structural fiscal deficit to 0.35% of GDP. Furthermore, an out-of-budget "Special Infrastructure Investment Fund" will be established over the next 12 years, with 100 billion euros of which will be used to fund Climate and Change Fund.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Financial dilemmas
     </strong>
     This massive fiscal expansion will take place against an economy suffering from negative output gaps and aging infrastructure. Although it could boost growth in the medium term, it is expected to significantly increase Germany's debt-to-GDP ratio from 63% in 2025 to 81% in 2035, fundamentally altering Germany's role as a financial anchor in the eurozone.
    </p>
    <h3 id="22-崩壊債務政治的行詰">
     2.2 France's collapse: Sovereign debt and political impasse
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Unsustainable fiscal trajectory
     </strong>
     France's public debt is on an explosive trajectory, with the European Commission forecasts that it is expected to rise from 113% in 2024 to 116.0% in 2025 and 118.4% in 2026. This is the third tallest in the EU after Greece and Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Constant deficit
     </strong>
     The fiscal deficit is also high, with a 5.6% level in 2025 and a -5.7% level in 2026, which is expected to significantly exceed the 3% level set by the Maastricht Treaty. The increase in interest payments is also a serious burden, and is expected to reach 2.9% of GDP by 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The political trauma
     </strong>
     : The core of France's problems lies in politics. As the parliament splits and political impassestion continues, fiscal reconstruction is in a near-impossible situation. In September 2025, the Austerity Budget proposed by Prime Minister François Byle was rejected, causing the government to collapse. The fall of the second prime minister in less than a year highlights the lack of governance under the current political system.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Market reaction
     </strong>
     : This political turmoil and the lack of a reliable path to fiscal sustainability undermines investors' trust. The IMF warns that the risk of a short-term debt crisis is low, but that the risk of a medium-term risk is "higher." France's total funding needs are expected to continue to exceed the high-risk level of 15% to GDP.
    </p>
    <p>
     The role of the German-France axis is beginning to be reversed. Historically, eurozone stability was based on the implicit assumption that Germany's fiscal discipline would support French (and other countries) fiscal spending. However, the data now shows that Germany is embarking on a massive debt-financed spending plan and is attempting to fundamentally change its financial DNA. At that very same time, France is in political paralysis, unable to implement even a slight austerity, and its debt is snowballing. This creates dangerous new mechanics. In future crises, there is no longer a clear "strong core" that will stabilize the system. Germany has lost its financial reserves and political legitimacy to demand austerity from other countries, while France's own crisis is a major source of system risk. The traditional stabilization mechanism of the eurozone is falling apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, the market is likely to make a strict distinction between the debts issued by Germany and France. Germany's new debt is clearly allocated to areas that are considered productive and growth-driven, such as defense, infrastructure and green transition. This can be interpreted as a "good debt" that increases long-term growth potential. In contrast, the French deficit is driven by structural overexpenditures, social security transfers and increasing interest payments, with no clear association with productive investments. This would be considered a "bad debt" to cover current consumption. As a result, even if the debt balance ratio of both countries rises, the market response is not uniform. The spread between French government bonds (OAT) and German government bonds is expected to expand significantly, reflecting not only French political risks, but also differences in the quality and purpose of the debt issued. This will further accelerate the divide pressure in the eurozone.

     Chapter III: Italy: Constant fault lines where sovereign risk and corporate risk intersect
    </h2>
    <p>
     Italy continues to be the source of the most significant systemic sovereign risks in the eurozone. This chapter analyzes how the country's fragile financial situation is linked to increased stress in the corporate sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.
    </p>
    <h3 id="31-btp-bund体温計">
     3.1 Sovereign Risk Premium: Thermometer called BTP-Bund Spread
    </h3>
    <p>
     The spread of 10-year Italian government bonds (BTP) and German government bonds is the most important indicator of market perceived Italy's risk. From late August to early September 2025, this spread has fluctuated, but remains at a high level of 85 to 95 basis points. This indicates that although lower than at the peak of the crisis, there is still a significant and constant risk premium. Italy's 10-year government bond yields are also around 3.50%, and this high borrowing cost is putting pressure on the national finances.
    </p>
    <h3 id="32-債務保有構造諸刃剣">
     3.2 The double-edged sword of debt holding structure
    </h3>
    <p>
     A major feature of the Italian government bond market is its high holdings by domestic investors. The majority of government bonds are held by domestic banks, households and insurance companies. In recent years, government bonds have also been successful for individual investors. This domestic holding structure provides a stable buyer base in the short term, while creating a dangerous "negative chain" between the state and the domestic banking system. In other words, a vicious cycle in which the price of government bonds directly damages the capital of Italian banks, triggering the banking crisis and further worsening the national financial situation. In a scenario of sovereign stress, where government bond prices fall and yields skyrocket, the balance sheets of these domestic holders suffer severe damage. This will cause the Italian banking system to become dysfunctional and require government relief. However, in order to bail out banks, the government, which is already at stake, will have to issue more debt, which will make the market even more uncertain and make the sovereign crisis worse. This feedback loop means that shocks to either the state or the banking system could quickly develop into a self-proliferating, total crisis. Risks are not spread across Europe, but are dangerously concentrated within Italy.
    </p>
    <h3 id="33-圧迫企業倒産信用状況">
     3.3 Corporate sector under pressure: bankruptcy and credit situation
    </h3>
    <p>
     Italian corporate bankruptcies are on the rise, with a forecast of +6% in 2025 and +1% in 2026, in contrast to the calming movements seen in France and the UK. Another forecast is expected to increase by +4% in 2025 and +3% in 2026. This increase is due to the delayed effect of monetary tightening after 2022. Although corporate borrowing rates fell slightly to 4.04% in June 2025, they still remain significantly above the low level of 1.62% in December 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable. Data from the Bank of Italy shows that the decline in loans is most pronounced among micro and small businesses, and these companies report difficulties in accessing credit. Bank lending standards across the eurozone were generally flat in the second quarter of 2025, but the situation facing Italian small and medium-sized enterprises remains severe, hindering investment and growth. Despite the high profitability of recent years, Italian banks are expected to see minimal deterioration in asset quality in 2025, but risks could emerge in 2026.
    </p>
    <p>
     This wave of rising bankruptcies among small and medium-sized enterprises is more than just a corporate-level issue. It is an important leading indicator that foresees future sovereign stress. Small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the Italian economy and are the main source of tax revenue and employment. As the data shows, bankruptcies are on a specific rise in Italy against the backdrop of high interest rates and strict credit access. If small and medium-sized enterprises go bankrupt one after another, government tax revenues will drop sharply, and social security spending such as unemployment benefits will increase sharply. This will exacerbate the fiscal deficit unexpectedly, forcing the government to issue more government bonds as confidence is already shaking. Therefore, microdata on firm-level health is a powerful predictor of future macro-level sovereign stress. Current trends suggest a deterioration in Italy's financial situation since 2026.

     Chapter IV: ECB's arsenal: Assessing the reliability and limitations of crisis interventions
    </h2>
    <p>
     This chapter critically evaluates the crisis management toolkit held by the European Central Bank (ECB). In particular, it focuses on the legal constraints placed on the mission and the realistic challenges and criticism associated with the main intervention measure, "Communication Protection Measures (TPI)."
    </p>
    <h3 id="41-根源的制約財政禁止tfeu第123条">
     4.1 Fundamental constraints: Prohibition of fiscal finance (TFEU Article 123)
    </h3>
    <p>
     The core of the ECB's mission is the prohibition of direct fiscal financing to the government as provided for in Article 123 of the Convention on the Function of the European Union (TFEU). It is designed to impose financial discipline on member states and ensure the ECB's main objective of price stability. Under this prohibition, the ECB cannot provide overdrafts to the government or directly underwrite government bonds in the secondary market. However, the treaty accepts important exceptions, which serves as the legal basis for the ECB's crisis response tool. This includes purchasing government bonds in the secondary market (secondary market) without escaping the purposes of the prohibited provisions, and emergency liquidity support (ELA) for banks with the ability to solve the issue.
    </p>
    <h3 id="42-危機対応進化omttpi">
     4.2 Evolution of Crisis Response Tools: From OMT to TPI
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Government Treasury Purchase Program (OMT)
     </strong>
     Introduced in 2012, OMT will allow national government bonds to be purchased in the secondary market under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)/European Stability Mechanism (ESM) support program. Due to this strict conditioning, the tool has never been invoked, but its very existence is believed to have calmed the sovereign debt crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP)
     </strong>
     : PEPP, which was used during the COVID-19 crisis, provided flexibility to deviate from the capital keys of each country, but was explicitly considered a temporary measure. This reinvestment is still positioned as the "first line of defense."
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Communication Protection Measures (TPI)
     </strong>
     : The TPI, introduced in July 2022, is a more permanent new tool to combat "unfair and disorderly market movements that seriously threaten the transmission of monetary policy." TPI allows public sector securities with redemption periods of 1 to 10 years to be purchased in the secondary market without prior restrictions, potentially unlimited.
    </p>
    <h3 id="43-tpi設計上欠陥裁量政治">
     4.3 Design flaws in the TPI: discretion, politics, and moral hazard
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Ambiguous criteria for activation
     </strong>
     : The activation of the TPI is left to the ECB's extremely discretion. The ECB must determine whether market movements are "unjust" and whether the target countries are pursuing "sound and sustainable" policies based on four broad standards: compliance with the EU fiscal framework, the absence of serious macroeconomic imbalances, fiscal sustainability, and sound policies.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Criticism of subjectivity
     </strong>
     : Critics argue that these conditions cannot be applied objectively and transparently, giving the ECB a wide range of policy discretion and facilitating succumbing to political pressure. These standards are considered merely "fig leaf" for the ECB to step beyond its mission and take financial support.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The dilemma of "unjustice"
     </strong>
     : It is almost impossible to prove that the market movement is "unfair." This is because it means that the ECB can predict the future economic pathways of the country with better information than the market.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Moral Hazard
     </strong>
     : The presence of TPIs creates significant moral hazards. Governments could have incentives to pursue unsustainable fiscal policies, hoping that the ECB will intervene and curb government bond spreads. This would disrupt market discipline, and is exactly the exact situation that the ban on fiscal finance tried to prevent.
    </p>
    <p>
     TPI's greatest strengths, flexibility and discretion, are at the same time its greatest weakness. Its reliability has not yet been tested, and due to its ambiguity it could disperse in a real crisis. The TPI was designed as a powerful deterrent to check speculators by threatening to unlimited purchases. However, its invocation depends on the ECB Policy Board's decisions based on subjective standards such as "unfair" market movements and "sound" policies. This decision will be extremely political in a crisis involving a major power with clear fiscal issues like France. Implementing a TPI against such a country is considered a relief that is contrary to the spirit of Article 123 of the TFEU and could face legal challenges. On the other hand, if not invoked, it would be considered to have broken its promise to protect the euro, causing panic in the market. This "reliability paradox" arises because the market knows that the invocation of the TPI is a political decision rather than a technical decision. Thus, investors will test the ECB's political will, and this tool may not function as a deterrent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Furthermore, the ECB toolkit has evolved to the point where the line between monetary policy (its mission) and financial support (which is prohibited) becomes dangerously blurred. Means like TPI are explicitly designed to manage sovereign spreads in a particular country. Managing the country's borrowing costs is functionally very similar to financial support, as it allows governments to raise funds at a lower cost than the market allows. The ECB justifies this in the name of "protection of monetary policy transmission," but critics see it as a "pretend for pretense." This ambiguity creates a serious institutional risk that politicizes the ECB, makes it vulnerable to legal challenges, and undermines the long-term credibility of its commitment to price stability, which is the very basis for the ban on fiscal finance.

     Chapter V: Shock Absorbents of the Financial System: Bank Resilience and Unfinished Capital Market Alliance
    </h2>
    <p>
     This chapter evaluates the ability of the broader financial architecture of the eurozone to absorb shocks. Contrast reported resilience of the banking sector with structural weaknesses caused by the unfinished capital market alliance.
    </p>
    <h3 id="51-銀行強靭性強力第一防衛線">
     5.1 Resilience of the banking sector: a strong first line of defense?
    </h3>
    <p>
     The 2025 EU Wide Stress Test, which covers 75% of EU bank assets, concluded that the banking sector is resilient to a severe hypothetical recession scenario. Under this tough scenario, the bank suffers a loss of 547 billion euros, but the shares, equal tier 1 (CET1) ratio, which is the core of its capital, is expected to remain at a high level of 12.0%. The decline in capital was 370 basis points, which is an improvement over the 2023 test results due to high profitability at the start of the test.
    </p>
    <p>
     The main sources of losses in stress testing are credit and market risk, which have been shown to be the major vulnerabilities of the banking sector. In addition, the introduction of Basel IV/CRR3 from January 2025 has been an important factor, particularly in terms of the impact of output floors on the capital adequacy ratio. Overall, the results are good, but there are also vulnerabilities. The countries most affected by stress testing were Ireland, Denmark and France, suggesting that there are regional differences in resilience.
    </p>
    <h3 id="52-未完資本市場同盟cmu欠落衝撃吸収材">
     5.2 Unfinished Capital Market Alliance (CMU): Missing Shock Absorbent
    </h3>
    <p>
     The Capital Markets Alliance (CMU), which was rebranded as the Savings and Investment Alliance (SIU) in March 2025, is a long-standing project to create a single capital market within the EU. The aim is to reduce reliance on bank lending, promote cross-border investment, and create mechanisms for risk sharing by the private sector. However, the progress is disappointingly slow. European capital markets are still divided, with financial integration at a lower level than before the 2008 financial crisis. This divide creates the substantial cost of companies missing funding opportunities under optimal conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The incompleteness of the CMU has a direct impact on financial stability. This means that it will reduce the risk-sharing capabilities of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), and that economic shocks will not be leveled by the flow of private capital and will be concentrated at the national level. This could force the ECB to act as the only game in town during a crisis, and could force larger and longer-term interventions, leading to excessive expansion of its mission. Incomplete contracts in divided markets complicate corporate financing and also contribute to increasing reliance on collateral and bank loans.
    </p>
    <p>
     The resilience of the banking sector shown by the EBA stress tests can create a certain illusion of security. The tests do not fully grasp the systemic risks posed by the "negative chain" with vulnerable nations and the unfinished CMU. Stress testing assesses banks' resistance to specific modeled macroeconomic scenarios, and is limited to replicating the nonlinear, self-enhancing feedback loops, as discussed in Chapter III, where sovereign and banking crises amplify each other. Furthermore, the soundness of the banking sector is only part of the equation. Because there is no deep integrated capital market, there is no alternative for the real economy to raise funds if bank lending channels freeze. During a crisis, businesses cannot easily switch funding from bank loans to capital markets. Therefore, the reported resilience of the banks does not guarantee overall system stability. The financial system as a whole remains vulnerable due to the lack of firewalls separating banks from the state from the diverse private capital markets, the main shock absorber. Systems are resistant to modelled shocks, but are fragile to the unmodelable dynamics of a crisis of trust.

The poor performance of giants like VW leads to a decline in investment, loss of jobs and lower tax revenues within Germany, further exacerbating the macroeconomic stagnation discussed in Chapter II. This forms a feedback loop for vulnerability, in which geopolitical risks have a negative impact on the national economy through corporate performance.

The company has a huge long-term debt of 68 billion euros, with 84% of which are fixed or hedged, curbing the risk of interest rate fluctuations. Net interest-bearing debt for the first half of 2025 has remained stable at 55.4 billion euros.

     <strong>
      Major risks
     </strong>
     : As a leading operator in Italy and Latin America, Enel is exposed to sovereign risks and regulatory changes in its major markets. The 2025-2027 strategic plan will include capital investments of 43 billion euros, most of which are concentrated in the transmission and distribution networks, which are regulated by Italy and Spain, so the stability of the regulatory frameworks of these countries will greatly influence the company's performance.

     6.4 Banking Sector - Credit Agricole S.A.
    </h3>
    <p>
     Credit Agricole has been awarded a high investment grade rating of A1 by Moody's and A+ by S&amp;P and Fitch, but S&amp;P and Fitch have said its outlook "negative" because of French sovereign risk. The bank has large-scale operations in France and Italy, and as of June 2025, it has a loan balance of 823 billion euros in France and 62 billion euros in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Direct Sovereign Exposure
     </strong>
     : The integrity of the bank is directly linked to the financial stability of France and Italy. The internal economic scenarios the bank uses to calculate allowances for loan losses include a deterioration scenario in which France's GDP shrinks by -1.9% in 2025 and -1.4% in 2026. This clearly shows that the sovereign vulnerabilities identified in Chapters II and III have a direct impact on the risk profiles of major European banks.

     7.1 Three Pillars of Vulnerability: Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
     The core findings revealed in this report can be summarised into the following three points:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A dangerous turn of Germany
       </strong>
       : Withdrawal of long-standing fiscal discipline amidst the economic weakness.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Political Stuck in France
       </strong>
       : There is no reliable political path to fiscal reconstruction and the sovereign debt crisis is underway.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Potential Negative Chain in Italy
       </strong>
       : The vulnerable national finances are closely intertwined with the domestic banking system and the fate of the stressed corporate sector.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The simultaneous progression of these three distinct, but interrelated vulnerabilities at the core of the eurozone creates an unprecedentedly fragile foundation.

     7.2 Systemic stress interpreted from market indicators
    </h3>
    <p>
     The market is beginning to factor in this growing risk in real time.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Sovereign CDS spread
       </strong>
       : The constant high levels of CDS spreads in France and Italy against Germany indicate that the two biggest economies whose markets are G7 members are seriously factoring in the risk of default or debt restructuring.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Gold price
       </strong>
       : The fact that gold prices hit a record high and outperformed the euro as a reserve asset is the most powerful signal of a long-term, structural loss of confidence in the eurozone institutional framework. This means escaping from the very promises of the nation.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        VSTOXX Volatility
       </strong>
       The VSTOXX index shows the degree of market "fear" and its sensitivity to political and economic news from core countries.

     7.3 Scenario Analysis: Routes to Financial Shocks
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Scenario A: Trigger from France
     </strong>
     A political impasse in France continues, causing a downgrade of government bonds by rating agencies. This will dramatically increase the spread between French and German government bonds. The ECB is forced to make a political decision on whether to activate the TPI or not, and the decision itself induces a credibility crisis for the ECB.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Scenario B: The Slow Crisis in Italy
     </strong>
     SMEs went bankrupt one after another in 2026, eroding Italy's growth and tax revenue base. This has made the financial situation worse than expected, rekindling concerns about a "negative chain" between the sovereign and the bank. Capital flight from Italian assets begins, leading to a crisis of scale that cannot be addressed by the ECB's existing tools.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Scenario C: Amplification of geopolitical shocks
     </strong>
     External shocks such as the intensifying Ukrainian War and the full-scale US-European trade war will directly hit the already weakened German economy. The German government's large-scale spending plan has become unsustainable and its fall into a major debt state, losing its credibility as an anchor for regional stability. This leads to a disorderly reassessment of risks across the eurozone.
    </p>
    <h3 id="74-戦略的展望結論">
     7.4 Strategic Perspectives and Conclusions
    </h3>
    <p>
     The eurozone is entering its most dangerous period since the sovereign debt crisis of 2010-2012. The nature of the risk has changed. It is no longer a problem with "peripheral countries," but a crisis rooted in the "core" of the eurozone. The combination of French political paralysis, Germany's economic weakness, and Italy's structural vulnerability creates multiple potential triggers that cause systemic events.
    </p>
    <p>
     The banking sector is at first glance strong, and the ECB has a new tool. However, the political will to use these tools in a way that blurs the line with fiscal relief is the ultimate uncertainty. The fact that sophisticated investors are already fleeing to gold suggests that hedges against institutional collapse has begun. The risk of a massive European financial shock is no longer a tail risk. It is a clear and current danger in a medium-term perspective.
